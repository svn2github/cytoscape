/**
 * This is an example task that demonstrates several features
 * of the {@link Task} and {@link Tunable} system.
 * <br/>
 * It uses a Tunable annotated field that demonstrates how users
 * can supply configuration information for a task.
 * <br/>
 * It inherits from an abstract class provided in the core
 * task API that provides pre-built support for many specific types
 * of tasks (this one is network related).
 * <br/>
 * It demonstrates how to update the {@link TaskMonitor} when 
 * running a Task.
 * <br/>
 * It demonstrates how to cancel a task when requested to do
 * so by a user.
