 License:     HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
              =======================

              JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
              primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
              took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.
              In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
              where it was renamed to Jython. Jython is developed by a group
              of volunteers.

              The standard library is covered by the BeOpen / CNRI license. See the
              Lib/LICENSE file for details.

              The oro regular expresion matcher is covered by the apache license.
              See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

              The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
              under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
              Software License.

                   written notice from CNRI of any material breach by the Licensee, if the
                   nature of the breach is such that it cannot be promptly remedied; or
                   (ii) sixty (60) days following notice from CNRI to Licensee of a
