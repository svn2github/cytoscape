> Our microarray is custom-made (not a catalogue-based),

> publication.
> 
> And, at this time, we would like to publish only one part.
> 
> We are planning to use other parts for other publications,
> and did not use these parts for the current publication at all,

> 
> Should we submit the whole FeatureExtraction files, even in such case?
> In other words, should we submit the unpublished data to public?
> 
> We would not like to submit the unpublished data to public.
> And, I think we have two choices to the raw data submission.
> 
> 1. We submit the lines of feature extraction file, corresponding to
> published data (of course including several header lines).
> 
> 2. We submit the whole feature extraction file, but somehow mask
> detailed information
> (gene annotation, and probe sequence etc.) of unpublished probes
> (numerical values would not be masked).
