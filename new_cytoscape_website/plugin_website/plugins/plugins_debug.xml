<![CDATA[BioQuali analyses regulatory networks and expression datasets by checking a global consistency between the regulatory model and the expression data. It diagnoses a regulatory network searching for the regulations that are not consistent with the expression data, and it outputs a set of genes which predicted expression is decided in order to explain the expression data provided.
The BioQuali Cytoscape Plugin proposes the user to visualize this analysis  automatically and in few minutes no matter the size of the network.]]>

The NetAtlas plugin allows the creation of tissue-defined networks, identification of network components that are more highly expressed in specific tissues, and the identification of network components that show correlated expression across tissues. The default tissue gene expression data available in NetAtlas is from SymAtlas and contains human, mouse, and rat gene expression data for a wide range of tissues and has been previously published by the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation. The user is also allowed to import their own tissue gene expression data in text file format.]]>
