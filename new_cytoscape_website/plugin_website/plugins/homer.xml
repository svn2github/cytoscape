      <description>Plugin designed to visualize, explore and analyze the proteins and interactions retrieved from the &lt;b&gt;unified interactome&lt;/b&gt; platform APID (which integrates BIND, BioGrid, DIP, HPRD, IncAct and MINT). The retrieved data include the &lt;b&gt;annotations and attributes associated&lt;/b&gt; to the network: GO terms, InterPro domains, experimental methods that validate each interaction, PubMed IDs, UniProt IDs. The tool provides interactive graphical representation of the &lt;b&gt;protein-protein interaction&lt;/b&gt; (PPI) networks within Cytoscape, plus new automatic tools to find &lt;b&gt;hubs&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;concurrent attributes&lt;/b&gt; (functional and structural) along the protein pairs of a given network.</description>

      <description>BioQuali analyses regulatory networks and expression datasets by checking a global consistency between the regulatory model and the expression data.  It diagnoses a regulatory network searching for the regulations that are not consistent with the expression data, and it outputs a set of genes which predicted expression is decided in order to explain the expression data provided.&lt;br&gt;The BioQuali Cytoscape Plugin proposes the user to visualize this analysis automatically and in few minutes no matter the size of the network.</description>

      <description>CentiScaPe computes specific centrality parameters describing the network topology. The centrality parameters aid the users to find the most significant nodes in a complex network. The plugin computation generates both numerical and graphical output making easy to find the key nodes also in large networks. Network topological quantification can be combined with other numerical node attributes to provide biologically meaningful node identification and functional classification.</description>

      <name>ClueGO</name>
      <description>ClueGO is a Cytoscape plug-in that visualizes the non-redundant biological terms for large clusters of genes in a functionally grouped network and it can be used in combination with GOlorize. The identifiers can be uploaded from a text file or interactively from a network of Cytoscape. The type of identifiers supported can be easely extended by the user. ClueGO performs single cluster analysis and comparison of clusters. From the ontology sources used, the terms are selected by different filter criteria. The related terms which share similar associated genes can be fused to reduce redundancy. The ClueGO network is created with kappa statistics and reflects the relationships between the terms based on the similarity of their associated genes. On the network, the node colour can be switched between functional groups and clusters distribution. ClueGO charts are underlying the specificity and the common aspects of the biological role. The significance of the terms and groups is automatically calculated. ClueGO is easy updatable with the newest files from Gene Ontology and KEGG.</description>

      <name>CytoSQL</name>
      <description>A plugin to execute SQL SELECT statements against relational databases, and convert the results table to Cytoscape network elements. It can be used to create new networks, extend existing networks or load extra attributes for selected network elements from any accessible relational database. Check the website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ptools.ua.ac.be/CytoSQL&quot;&gt;http://www.ptools.ua.ac.be/CytoSQL&lt;/a&gt;)for common use cases.</description>

      <description>The GPML plugin for Cytoscape is a converter between Cytoscape networks and the GPML (GenMAPP Pathway Markup Language) pathway format.&lt;p&gt;This plugin makes it possible open and save GPML pathways from Cytoscape. You can also copy/paste bits of pathways or networks between PathVisio, WikiPathways and Cytoscape. The plugin provides a webservice client to directly search and open pathways on WikiPathways&lt;br&gt;See http://www.pathvisio.org/Cytoscape_plugin for more information and http://www.wikipathways.org for a collection of GPML pathways.</description>

      <description>The GPML plugin for Cytoscape is a converter between Cytoscape networks and the GPML (GenMAPP Pathway Markup Language) pathway format.&lt;p&gt;This plugin makes it possible open and save GPML pathways from Cytoscape. You can also copy/paste bits of pathways or networks between PathVisio, WikiPathways and Cytoscape. The plugin provides a webservice client to directly search and open pathways on WikiPathways&lt;br&gt;See http://www.pathvisio.org/Cytoscape_plugin for more information and http://www.wikipathways.org for a collection of GPML pathways.</description>

      <description>MCODE finds clusters (highly interconnected regions) in a network. Clusters mean different things in different types of networks. For instance, clusters in a protein-protein interaction network are often protein complexes and parts of pathways, while clusters in a protein similarity network represent protein families.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MetScape provides a bioinformatics framework for the visualization and interpretation of metabolomic data. Metabolomic data from HUMDB, EHMN and KEGG is integrated and stored in a database at NCIBI. MetScape allows users to trace the connections between metabolites and genes. MetScape allows users to upload experimental data, and visualize compound networks over time, or experimental conditions. Color and size of the nodes can be used to visualize these changes. MetScape can display the entire metabolic network or any of the pathway-specific networks that exist in NCIBI database. This work was supported by grant U54DA021519 from NIH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motivation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Although gene expression data has been continuously accumulated and meta-analysis approaches have been developed to integrate independent expression profiles into larger datasets, the amount of information is still insufficient to infer large scale genetic networks. In addition, global optimization such as Bayesian network inference, one of the most representative techniques for genetic network inference, requires tremendous computational load far beyond the capacity of moderate workstations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; MONET is a Cytoscape plugin to infer genome-scale networks from gene expression profiles. It alleviates the shortage of information by incorporating pre-existing annotations. The current version of MONET utilizes thousands of parallel computational cores in the supercomputing center in KISTI, Korea, to cope with the computational requirement for large scale genetic network inference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Lee et al., Modularized learning of genetic interaction networks from biological annotations and mRNA expression data. &lt;i&gt;Bioinformatics&lt;/i&gt; (2005) 21, 2739-2747</description>

      <name>NetAtlas</name>
      <description>NetAtlas is a Java plugin application designed to use tissue gene expression data to filter genes in a cellular signaling network. The NetAtlas plugin allows the creation of tissue-defined networks, identification of network components that are more highly expressed in specific tissues, and the identification of network components that show correlated expression across tissues. The default tissue gene expression data available in NetAtlas is from SymAtlas and contains human, mouse, and rat gene expression data for a wide range of tissues and has been previously published by the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation. The user is also allowed to import their own tissue gene expression data in text file format.</description>

      <description>The PerturbationAnalyzer is an open source java plugin for Cytoscape to evaluate the propagation effects on interaction networks by comparing the equilibrium states before and after certain perturbation. Given an interaction network and initial parameters, the PerturbationAnalyzer finds the equilibrium state governed by the law of mass action (LMA) for protein binding network, and generates a customizable view to provide an intuitive visual representation of the result of the propagation effect on the network.

      <name>ShortestPath Plugin</name>
      <description>ShortestPath is a plugin for Cytoscape 2.1 to show the shortest path between 2 selected nodes in the current network. It supports both directed and undirected networks and it gives the user the possibility to choose which node (of the selected ones) should be used as source and target (useful for directed networks). The plugin API makes possible to use its functionality from another plugin.</description>
