      <html_content value="Fatty acids from Plasmodium falciparum down-regulate the toxic activity of malaria glycosylphosphatidylinositols. Plasmodium falciparum malaria kills roughly 2.5 million people, mainly children, annually. Much of this mortality is thought to arise from the actions of a malarial toxin. This toxin, identified as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), is a major pathogenicity determinant in malaria. A malarial molecule, Pfj, labeled by [3H]glucosamine like the GPIs, was identified as a non-GPI molecule. Here we show that Pfj is able to down-regulate tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production induced by the GPI of P. falciparum. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Pfj was not a single molecule but represented a number of molecules. Separation methods, such as cation-exchange chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, were used to isolate and identify the following four main fatty acids responsible for the inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha production: myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitic, and palmitoleic acids. This regulatory effect on cytokine production suggests that there is balanced bioactivity for the different categories of malarial lipids." />

      <html_content value="Endogenous opioids, mu-opiate receptors and chloroquine-induced pruritus: a double-blind comparison of naltrexone and promethazine in patients with malaria fever who have an established history of generalized chloroquine-induced itching. AIMS: Chloroquine induces a severe generalized pruritus, in predisposed Black African patients, during treatment of malaria fever, and also in some Caucasian patients treated for rheumatological diseases. We have previously shown that chloroquine may release endogenous opioids and/or interact with micro-opiate receptors in rats, and that both histamine and malaria parasite blood density, contribute to the itching severity in malaria fever in humans. The aim of our present study was to assess and compare the antipruritic efficacy of the micro-opiate receptor antagonist, naltrexone, and the antihistamine, promethazine, in chloroquine treated patients with malaria fever. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, parallel group comparison of the chloroquine-induced pruritus intensity and time profile in patients with parasitologically proven malaria fever, who were pretreated with a single dose of either naltrexone 50 mg or promethazine 25 mg orally (six patients each). All patients had an established history of severe pruritus following chloroquine treatment of malaria fever. A self-assessed itching severity score was undertaken at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after initial chloroquine dosing, and the areas under the pruritus-intensity time curve AUCP0-72 h was determined in each patient and correlated to the malaria parasite density in blood. RESULTS: Both naltrexone and promethazine subjectively reduced itching severity compared with prior historical experience. One patient on naltrexone and two on promethazine never experienced any itching. There was no statistically significant treatment effect, but a significant time effect (P = 0.001, F = 4.77 d.f. 5) by two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The AUCP for naltrexone was 82 +/- 25 units/h, and 57 +/- 34 units/h for promethazine [95% confidence interval for the difference being -73 to 123]. However, the malaria parasite density in the naltrexone group (740 +/- 178 microl(-1)) tended to be higher than in the promethazine group 314 +/- 69 microl(-1) (P = 0.056, 95% confidence interval for the difference being -15 to 866 microl(-1)). Correction of the AUCP for malaria parasite density (parasite pruritogenic index, AUCP. units/h/parasites/microl blood) tended to be lower with naltrexone 9.1 +/- 2.6 than with promethazine 12.2 +/- 7.0 There was a highly significant and positive correlation between the malaria parasite density and the AUCP0-72 h, on naltrexone (r2 = 0.78, P = 0.040) and promethazine (r2 = 0.93, P = 0.008). However, comparison of regressions revealed that the slope of the regression was significantly steeper with promethazine 0.48 than naltrexone 0.12 (P = 0.006, t = 4.2), with the intercepts showing a trend to a difference (P = 0.086). CONCLUSION: Naltrexone exerted an antipruritic action, at least to a similar extent to promethazine in patients with chloroquine-induced itching in malaria fever. However, the relationship between parasite density and resultant pruritus was significantly different between naltrexone and promethazine. Thus, micro-opiate receptors/and or endogenous opioids may contribute to chloroquine itching in malaria fever, in humans, in accord with animal experimental findings. Malaria parasite density in blood is a strong determinant of itching severity in patients predisposed to chloroquine-induced pruritus." />

      <html_content value="Interaction between chloroquine and diverse pharmacological agents in chloroquine resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis. The effect of a number of pharmacological agents on the enhancement of antimalarial activity of chloroquine was evaluated against chloroquine resistant line of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (N-67). The response after combination therapy was monitored on the basis of alteration in the course of parasitaemia, the extension of mean survival time and the percent cure rate in different groups. The study was designed to compare the in vivo efficacy of a number of resistance modulating agents found effective in several in vitro studies against chloroquine resistant P. falciparum isolates. Based on their efficacy in this rodent model, the response of combination of chloroquine with agents representing diverse chemical moieties has been categorised as curative, moderately active and inactive. Out of the 22 agents evaluated, only cyproheptadine-chloroquine combination produced curative response. Ketotifen, azatadine, pheniramine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, verapamil, penfluridol and trifluoperazine demonstrated moderate activity while loratadine, terfenadine, promethazine, ranitidine, nifedipine, diltiazem, chlorpromazine, amiodarone, tamoxifen, dipyridamol, propranolol, acyclovir and amantidine were inactive. The study advocates the suitability of proposed rodent model to shortlist potential resistance reversal agents." />

      <html_content value="Mechanisms of chloroquine-induced body-scratching behavior in rats: evidence of involvement of endogenous opioid peptides. Chloroquine is commonly used in the chemotherapy of malaria fever, and as an antiinflammatory disease-modifying agent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Administration of chloroquine (20.0 mg/kg IP) significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) increased the frequency of body scratching in rats to 29.5+/-9 in 30 min, compared to saline control animals (6.5+/-2/30 min). Morphine, a mu-opiate receptor agonist (1.0 mg/kg IP), potentiated the chloroquine-induced rat body scratching to 40+/-6.6, while the mu-opiate receptor antagonist, naltrexone (0.25 mg/kg, IP, given 15 min prior) blocked the chloroquine induced body scratching to 4.5+/-2 (p &amp;lt; 0.05 ANOVA). In addition, the frequency of chloroquine (20.0 mg/kg IP)-induced body scratching was significantly reduced to 9.1+/-3 in 30 min in rats rendered tolerant to morphine (p &amp;lt; 0.05 ANOVA) compared to the scratching frequency of 40+/-6.6 in morphine-naive rats. These suggests an involvement of mu-opioid receptors and/or endogenous opioid peptides in chloroquine induced body scratching in rats. Promethazine, a histamine-receptor antagonist (1.0 mg/kg IP, given 15 min prior to chloroquine) and the corticosteroid, dexamethasone (1.0 mg/kg, IP, given 15 min prior) separately and significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.01) inhibited the chloroquine-induced scratching in rats, in a similar manner to clinical studies in malaria. Collectively, the novel results implicate opioidergic mechanisms, and confirm the efficacy of antihistamine and corticosteroids in chloroquine body scratching in rats. It also strongly suggests that the chloroquine-induced body-scratching behavior in the rat may be a useful experimental model for chloroquine-induced pruritus in humans." />

The effect of combining promethazine with chloroquine was examined against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro in the Aotus-P. falciparum model and in bioassays from volunteers given promethazine. The combination of chloroquine plus promethazine (1 x 10(-6) M) reversed chloroquine resistance in standard P. falciparum clones and patient parasite isolates from Nigeria. The combination reduced the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) for chloroquine against resistant parasites by 32-92%. Coadministration of promethazine with chloroquine also demonstrated a dose-dependent effect in Aotus monkeys infected with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Monkeys were given a chloroquine dose (20 mg/kg of body weight for seven days), which normally has no effect on parasitemia, plus 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg of promethazine/kg of body weight. In one monkey, parasitemia was suppressed at the lowest promethazine dose, but re-treatment with 20 mg/kg resulted in clearance of parasitemia. Initial treatment with chloroquine and 20 or 40 mg/kg of promethazine cleared parasitemia in some animals followed by recrudescence. Re-treatment at higher doses cured one monkey and resulted in initial clearance and delayed recrudescence 28 or 63 days after treatment in two monkeys. Recrudescent parasitemia in the two monkeys was low (10 parasites/microl of blood) and subsequently cleared without re-treatment. An in vitro bioassay model was developed to examine the effects of clinically achievable doses of promethazine on parasites susceptibilities in vitro. Plasma samples taken at hourly intervals from patients given a single oral dose of 25 mg of promethazine decreased the IC50 values for chloroquine by 20-58% with the most significant reductions occurring in plasma obtained from volunteers 3-4 hr after ingestion. Plasma obtained from two volunteers 6 hr after ingestion of the drug demonstrated no effect on chloroquine susceptibility, suggesting that study of the pharmacokinetic disposition and potential interaction is warranted to optimize the dose regimen in patients for antimalarial efficacy. Historic use of this drug combination for treatment or prevention of chloroquine-associated pruritus or as an antiemetic suggest that the combination is safe and effective when used at standard dosages. The results from this study demonstrate that promethazine is a potent modulator of chloroquine resistance. Clinical evaluation of therapeutic regimens is required to validate clinical efficacy of this promising combination for treatment of uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant malaria." />

      <html_content value="Chloroquine-induced pruritus in malaria fever: contribution of malaria parasitaemia and the effects of prednisolone, niacin, and their combination, compared with antihistamine. AIMS: Chloroquine treatment of malaria fever, results in a generalized pruritus of unknown mechanism in up to 60% of adult Africans, by contrast pruritus is unusual in Caucasians following chloroquine use. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study to examine and compare the antipruritic effects of promethazine, niacin, prednisolone and their combination on pruritus induced by chloroquine, in 28 historical itching patients with parasitologically proven malaria fever. We also evaluated the role of the antecedent malaria parasite density in the severity of chloroquine pruritus intensity. RESULTS: The concurrent administration of chloroquine (2.1 g base total dose) with prednisolone caused a statistically significant reduction in the pruritus AUC (0, 72 h) (P &amp;lt; 0.001 ANOVA) compared with the antihistamine promethazine alone. The areas under the pruritus intensity-time curve were promethazine 105 +/- 28 (units h), niacin 76 +/- 22, prednisolone 28 +/- 24, and prednisolone and niacin 34 +/- 17 (P &amp;lt; 0.001 ANOVA). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in the pruritus AUC between prednisolone and promethazine was 8.4 to 145.6 units h. There was a statistically significant and positive correlation between the pruritus intensity (AUC 0, 72 h) and the malaria parasite load in the itching subjects, not receiving prednisolone (n = 9) (r = 0.73, P = 0.026 ANOVA). CONCLUSION: A single oral dose of prednisolone (10 mg) may be preferable to the antihistamine promethazine (25 mg) as an antipruritic agent for concurrent prescription with chloroquine in individuals predisposed to severe itching. Malaria parasite clearance and clinical amelioration were unaffected by any of the treatments." />

      <html_content value="Responsiveness of chloroquine-induced pruritus to antihistamine therapy--a clinical survey. A clinical survey in Benin (Nigeria) has revealed that 393 out of 541 respondents experienced pruritus (itching) whenever they took chloroquine for malaria treatment. The reaction was always severe in 90% of the cases. Based on this experience, the pruritus-prone subjects were subsequently given antihistamine therapy either 30 min before or along with chloroquine administration (initial dose, 600 mg base oral, or 200 mg base i.m.). The success rates obtained with the following antihistamines were 49% (chlorpheniramine maleate, 4-8 mg oral), 46% (mepyramine maleate, 50-100 mg oral), and 60% (Promethazine hydrochloride, 50 mg oral or i.m.). Promethazine appears to be the most effective in the prevention of chloroquine-induced pruritus but the differences were not significant. The antihistamine was more frequently given 30 min before chloroquine, but this had no advantage over the concomitant administration of the two drugs, which may therefore be presented in one dosage form for a better treatment compliance." />

The role of enzymatic deamination of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine in the in vitro growth of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was investigated by means of human red cells deficient in AMP deaminase to which the adenosine deaminase inhibitor 2&apos;-deoxycoformycin was added. Malaria parasites grew normally in red cells lacking one or both of these enzyme activities. As a further probe of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) catabolism, both infected and uninfected RBCs were incubated with NaF (with and without 2&apos;-deoxycoformycin) and the purine nucleotide/nucleoside content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Uninfected RBCs lacking either AMP or adenosine deaminase were able to bypass the enzyme block and degrade ATP to hypoxanthine. Uninfected RBCs with both deaminases blocked were unable to produce significant quantities of hypoxanthine. On the other hand, infected RBCs were able to bypass blockade of both deaminases and produce hypoxanthine and adenosine. These findings establish that deamination of adenosine and/or AMP are not essential for plasmodial growth. However, further work will be required to elucidate the pathways that permit the parasites to bypass these catabolic steps." />

      <html_content value="Mosquito natriuretic peptide identified as a calcitonin-like diuretic hormone in Anopheles gambiae (Giles). Mosquito natriuretic peptide (MNP), an uncharacterised peptide from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, acts via cyclic AMP to stimulate secretion of Na+-rich urine by opening a Na+ conductance in the basolateral membrane of Malpighian tubule principal cells. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-related peptides and calcitonin (CT)-like diuretic peptides use cyclic AMP as a second messenger and were therefore considered likely candidates for MNP. BLAST searches of the genome of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, gave sequences for the CRF-related peptide Anoga-DH44 and the CT-like peptide Anoga-DH31, which were synthesised and tested for effects on Malpighian tubules from An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti, together with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. The cyclic AMP analogue stimulated secretion of Na+-rich urine by An. gambiae Malpighian tubules, reproducing the response to MNP in Ae. aegypti. It also depolarised the principal cell basolateral membrane voltage (Vb) while hyperpolarising the transepithelial voltage (Vt) to a similar extent. Anoga-DH4) and Anoga-DH31 stimulated production of cyclic AMP, but not cyclic GMP, by Malpighian tubules of An. gambiae. Both peptides had diuretic activity, but only Anoga-DH31 had natriuretic activity and stimulated fluid secretion to the same extent as 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Likewise, Anoga-DH31 reproduced the effects of cyclic AMP on tubule electrophysiology, whereas Anoga-DH44 initially hyperpolarised Vb and depolarised Vt, which is the opposite of the effect of Anoga-DH31. Anoga-DH44 and Anoga-DH31 were also tested for effects on fluid secretion and ion transport by Ae. aegypti tubules. As in An. gambiae, the CRF-related peptide Anoga-DH44 had a non-specific effect on the transport of Na+ and K+, whereas the CT-like peptide Anoga-DH31 specifically stimulated transepithelial Na+ transport. We conclude that the CT-like peptide Anoga-DH31 is the previously uncharacterised mosquito natriuretic peptide." />

      <html_content value="Augmented IL-10 production and redox-dependent signaling pathways in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient mouse peritoneal macrophages. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) supports cellular antioxidant pathways. G6PD deficiency is associated with malaria protection but was shown to worsen the clinical course to injury. This study tested whether G6PD deficiency manifests in altered cytokine responses using peritoneal macrophages from a G6PD-deficient mouse model with a degree of defect similar to the common type A(-) human G6PD deficiency. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 production was doubled in G6PD-deficient macrophages compared with wild-type (WT). Protein kinase C (PKC) activation by phorbol-ester prior to LPS resulted in a fivefold greater IL-10 production in G6PD-deficient macrophages compared with WT. Interferon-gamma treatment prior to LPS augmented IL-12 production in G6PD-deficient and WT macrophages and partially inhibited IL-10 production by G6PD-deficient macrophages. The antioxidants (N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione ethyl-ester) blunted IL-10 and IL-12 production, indicating a role for oxidative stress in the observed response differences between deficient and WT macrophages. LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein, and specificity protein 3 was augmented in G6PD-deficient cells compared with WT. The PKCdelta inhibitor Rottlerin inhibited IL-10 and IL-12 production at different 50% effective-dose concentrations between deficient and WT macrophages, indicating elevated PKCdelta activity in deficient cells. This study reveals that activated G6PD-deficient macrophages display an augmented production of cytokines with a prominent impact on IL-10 production. The altered cytokine responses are associated with augmented activation of redox-dependent transcription factors and PKCdelta. Alterations in signaling pathways and associated changes in cytokine production may play a role in modulating the inflammatory responses following bacterial or malarial infections in G6PD deficiency." />

We have previously reported that infection with Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium chabaudi, or injection of extracts from malaria-parasitized red blood cells induces hypoglycemia in normal mice and normalizes the hyperglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice. P yoelii glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) were extracted in chloroform:methanol:water (CMW) (10:10:3), purified by high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and tested for their insulin-mimetic activities. The effects of P yoelii GPIs on blood glucose were investigated in insulin-resistant C57BL/ks-db/db diabetic mice. A single intravenous injection of GPIs (9 and 30 nmol/mouse) induced a significant dose-related decrease in blood glucose (P &amp;lt; .001), but insignificantly increased plasma insulin concentrations. A single oral dose of 2.7 micromol GPIs per db/db mouse significantly lowered blood glucose (P &amp;lt; .01). P yoelii GPIs in vitro (0.062 to 1 micromol/L) significantly stimulated lipogenesis in rat adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner both in the presence and absence of 10(-8) mol/L insulin (P &amp;lt; .01). P yoelii GPIs stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDH-Pase) and inhibited both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). P yoelii GPIs had no effect on the activity of the gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This is the first report of the hypoglycemic effect of P yoelii GPIs in murine models of type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, P yoelii GPIs demonstrated acute antidiabetic effects in db/db mice and in vitro. We suggest that P yoelii GPIs, when fully characterized, may provide structural information for the synthesis of new drugs for the management of diabetes." />

      <html_content value="Solute-inhibitor interactions in the plasmodial surface anion channel reveal complexities in the transport process. Human red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite, P. falciparum, have markedly increased permeabilities to diverse organic and inorganic solutes. The plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC), recently identified with electrophysiological methods, contributes to the uptake of many small solutes. Here, we explored the effects of known PSAC antagonists on transport of different solutes. Unexpectedly, the transport of two solutes, phenyltrimethylammonium and isoleucine, was only partially inhibited by concentrations of three inhibitors that abolish sorbitol or alanine uptake. Residual uptake via endogenous transporters could not account for this finding because uninfected red blood cells (RBCs) do not have adequate permeability for these solutes. In infected RBCs, the residual uptake of these solutes could be abolished by higher concentrations of specific and non-specific PSAC antagonists. It could also be abolished by adding sorbitol or alanine, permeant solutes that do not exhibit residual uptake. The residual uptake did not exhibit anomalous mole fraction behavior and had a steep activation energy. These observations exclude uptake via unrelated pathways and instead point to differences in how PSAC recognizes and transports various solutes. We propose a possible model that also may help explain PSAC&apos;s unique selectivity properties." />

      <html_content value="Transport of the essential nutrient isoleucine in human erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite derives much of its requirement for amino acids from the digestion of the hemoglobin of its host cell. However, one amino acid, isoleucine, is absent from adult human hemoglobin and must therefore be obtained from the extracellular medium. In this study we have characterized the mechanisms involved in the uptake of isoleucine by the intraerythrocytic parasite. Under physiologic conditions the rate of transport of isoleucine into human erythrocytes infected with mature trophozoite-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites is increased to approximately 5-fold that in uninfected cells, with the increased flux being via the new permeability pathways (NPPs) induced by the parasite in the host cell membrane. Transport via the NPPs ensures that protein synthesis is not rate limited by the flux of isoleucine across the erythrocyte membrane. On entering the infected erythrocyte, isoleucine is taken up into the parasite via a saturable, ATP-, Na+-, and H+-independent system which has the capacity to mediate the influx of isoleucine in exchange for leucine (liberated from hemoglobin). The accumulation of radiolabeled isoleucine within the parasite is mediated by a second (high-affinity, ATP-dependent) mechanism, perhaps involving metabolism and/or the concentration of isoleucine within an intracellular organelle." />

      <html_content value="Plasmodium falciparum ensures its amino acid supply with multiple acquisition pathways and redundant proteolytic enzyme systems. Degradation of host hemoglobin by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a massive metabolic process. What role this degradation plays and whether it is essential for parasite survival have not been established, nor have the roles of the various degradative enzymes been clearly defined. We report that P. falciparum can grow in medium containing a single amino acid (isoleucine, the only amino acid missing from human hemoglobin). In this medium, growth of hemoglobin-degrading enzyme gene knockout lines (missing falcipain-2 and plasmepsins alone or in combination) is impaired. Blockade of plasmepsins with the potent inhibitor pepstatin A has a minimal effect on WT parasite growth but kills falcipain-2 knockout parasites at low concentrations and is even more potent on falcipain-2, plasmepsin I and IV triple knockout parasites. We conclude that: (i) hemoglobin degradation is necessary for parasite survival; (ii) hemoglobin degradation is sufficient to supply most of the parasite&apos;s amino acid requirements; (iii) external amino acid acquisition and hemoglobin digestion are partially redundant nutrient pathways; (iv) hemoglobin degradation uses dual protease families with overlapping function; and (v) hemoglobin-degrading plasmepsins are not promising drug targets." />

      <html_content value="Double cross-over gene replacement within the sec 7 domain of a GDP-GTP exchange factor from Plasmodium falciparum allows the generation of a transgenic brefeldin A-resistant parasite line. High molecular weight ADP ribosylation factor GDP-GTP exchange factors (ARF-GEF) play an essential role in the formation of COP I coated transport vesicles and are characterized by a structurally and functionally conserved sec 7 domain. The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum encodes a single ARF-GEF that contains an unusual sec 7 domain. In comparison to the sec 7 domain of other eukaryotes, the plasmodial sec 7 domain is characterized by an insertion sequence of 146 amino acids that disrupt helices essential for the GDP-GTP exchange activity of the protein. In a previous study we have shown a correlation between a methionine to isoleucine exchange in helix H of the sec 7 domain and resistance to brefeldin A in a parasite line generated by drug selection. Here we have transfected brefeldin A sensitive parasites with plasmid constructs containing the sec 7 domain of the resistant line either with or without the insertion sequence. Transfection with sec 7 sequences including the insertion resulted in brefeldin A resistant parasites in which double cross-over recombination had replaced the endogenous sec 7 sequences with the transgenic sequences. Thus, the point mutation in helix H is sufficient to confer brefeldin A resistance in P. falciparum. Transfections using constructs lacking the insertion did not result in resistant parasites. Gene replacement by targeted double cross-over recombination is a rare event in P. falciparum. This approach has taken advantage of the fact that the successful integration of the transgene results in a drug selectable phenotype. We anticipate that the strategy described here will be useful for the identification of mutations within target genes that have the potential to confer increased drug resistance." />

The ability to measure accurately comparative levels of protein expression after drug challenge, metabolic stress, developmental programming or other perturbation represents one of the most important goals in post-genomics malaria research. We describe here a simple and robust quantitative methodology that is ideally suited to in vitro experiments designed to study changes in the proteome of the most important of the human parasites, the lethal species Plasmodium falciparum. The metabolic labelling technique we have developed uses parasite uptake of heavy isotope-containing isoleucine during normal growth followed by two-dimensional separation of individual proteins and mass spectrometry. The method is applicable to essentially each of the approximately 5300 proteins of P. falciparum predicted from the completed genome sequence, permitting facile identification and accurate comparative quantification of labelled peptides from any of these proteins synthesized by in vitro cultures subjected to different stimuli. We demonstrate its application to the study of cell cycle changes, where we observe divergent patterns of protein and reported transcript levels indicative of modulation at the translational level. Our data also provide evidence for significant levels of post-translational modification in the parasite, and we measure differences among variants of phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase and actin-I across the cell cycle. We have also monitored parasite responses to equipotent doses of the clinical antimalarial inhibitors pyrimethamine and tetracycline and observed differential effects for a number of proteins unrelated to likely targets of these drugs." />

      <html_content value="Properties and prediction of mitochondrial transit peptides from Plasmodium falciparum. A neural network approach for the prediction of mitochondrial transit peptides (mTPs) from the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum is presented. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein precursors of P. falciparum were analyzed by statistical methods, principal component analysis and supervised neural networks, and were compared to those of other eukaryotes. A distinct amino acid usage pattern has been found in protein encoding regions of P. falciparum: glycine, alanine, tryptophan and arginine are under-represented, whereas isoleucine, tyrosine, asparagine and lysine are over-represented compared to the SwissProt average. Similar patterns were observed in mTPs of P. falciparum. Using principal component analysis (PCA), mTPs from P. falciparum were shown to differ considerably from those of other organisms. A neural network system (PlasMit) for prediction of mTPs in P. falciparum sequences was developed, based on the relative amino acid frequency in the first 24 N-terminal amino acids, yielding a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.74 (90% correct prediction) in a 20-fold cross-validation study. This system predicted 1177 (22%) mitochondrial genes, based on 5334 annotated genes in the P. falciparum genome. A second network with the same topology was trained to give more conservative estimate. This more stringent network yielded a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.51 (84% correct prediction) in a 10-fold cross-validation study. It predicted 381 (7.1%) mitochondrial genes, based on 5334 annotated genes in the P. falciparum genome." />

      <html_content value="Molecular surveillance of the antifolate-resistant mutation I164L in imported African isolates of Plasmodium falciparum in Europe: sentinel data from TropNetEurop. BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites that carry the DHFR-mutation I164L are not only highly resistant to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine but also to the new antimalarial drug chlorproguanil-dapsone. The spread of this mutation in Africa would result in a public health disaster since there is a lack of effective alternatives that are both affordable and safe. Up to now, this mutation has only been described in Asian and Latin-American countries. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of this mutation in African isolates of Plasmodium falciparum that have been imported into Europe through travellers. METHODS: TropNetEurop is a network for the surveillance of travel-associated diseases and seems to cover approximately 12% of all malaria cases imported into Europe. Within this network we screened 277 imported African isolates of P. falciparum with the help of PCR- and enzyme-digestion-methods for the antifolate-resistant mutation I164L. RESULTS: The I164L mutation was not detected in any of the isolates tested. DISCUSSION: Continuous molecular surveillance of mutations in P. falciparum, as it is practised within TropNetEurop, is an essential tool for the understanding and early detection of the spread of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa." />

      <html_content value="N-terminal contributions of the gamma-subunit of fetal hemoglobin to its tetramer strength: remote effects at subunit contacts. The greatly increased tetramer strength of liganded fetal hemoglobin compared with adult hemoglobin is shown by its 70-fold smaller tetramer-dimer dissociation constant. This property has been shown previously to be only partially caused by the 5-amino-acid differences at both types of interfaces in each hemoglobin. A major contributor to tetramer strengthening is the 18-amino-acid N-terminal A helix of the gamma-subunit of fetal hemoglobin, which differs from the beta-subunit of adult hemoglobin at eight amino acid residues. This long-distance communication between the A helix and the distant C helix and FG helical corner comprising the subunit contacts at the allosteric interface represents internal signaling. Physiologically, its greater tetramer strength endows fetal hemoglobin with the capacity to abstract oxygen from maternal adult hemoglobin. It also leads to resistance of fetal red cells to the malaria parasite because the HbF tetramer does not dissociate to dimers as readily as HbA; dimers are digested by malaria proteases but tetramers are not. In this communication, we report which sites on the A helix of the gamma-subunit are important for tetramer strengthening in HbF by substituting certain amino acids in the beta-subunit by the corresponding residues in the gamma-subunit. The recombinant hemoglobins containing up to five replacements together have been extensively characterized. Mass values were within 1 unit of theory. Gly 1 (gamma) of HbF with its high pK(a) of 8.1 compared with a 7.1 value for Val 1 (beta) of HbA creates a highly electropositive N terminus that may couple with the electronegative sequence just after it on the gamma-subunit. The Leu 3 to Phe replacement has no apparent role; however, position 5 is important because replacement of Pro 5 (beta) by Glu 5 (gamma) promotes tetramer strengthening. The Glu --&gt; Asp replacement at position 7 enhances this effect because of the lower pK(a) of Asp but the Val --&gt; Ile substitution at position 11 has no effect. Thus, the three positive/negative sites at positions 1, 5, and 7 account for practically all of the tetramer strength of HbF, as illustrated by an electrostatic surface potential analysis. The pathway by which information is transmitted to the distant allosteric subunit interfaces is currently under study. Oxygen-binding properties of the hemoglobins with charged substitutions more closely resemble those of HbA rather than those of HbF. Thus, whereas the A helix has a major role in controlling the strength of interactions at the tetramer-dimer allosteric interface, oxygen-binding properties of HbA and HbF are influenced by sequences in the C helix and at the FG helical corner constituting the allosteric interface." />

      <html_content value="Deciphering apicoplast targeting signals--feature extraction from nuclear-encoded precursors of Plasmodium falciparum apicoplast proteins. The malaria causing protozoan Plasmodium falciparum contains a vestigal, non-photosynthetic plastid, the apicoplast. Numerous proteins encoded by nuclear genes are targeted to the apicoplast courtesy of N-terminal extensions. With the impending sequence completion of an entire genome of the malaria parasite, it is important to have software tools in place for prediction of subcellular locations for all proteins. Apicoplast targeting signals are bipartite; containing a signal peptide and a transit peptide. Nuclear-encoded apicoplast protein precursors were analyzed for characteristic features by statistical methods, principal component analysis, self-organizing maps, and supervised neural networks. The transit peptide contains a net positive charge and is rich in asparagine, lysine, and isoleucine residues. A novel prediction system (PATS, predict apicoplast-targeted sequences) was developed based on various sequence features, yielding a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.91 (97% correct predictions) in a 40-fold cross-validation study. This system predicted 22% apicoplast proteins of the 205 potential proteins on P. falciparum chromosome 2, and 21% of 243 chromosome 3 proteins. A combination of the PATS results with a signal peptide prediction yields 15% potentially nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins on chromosomes 2 and 3. The prediction tool will advance P. falciparum genome analysis, and it might help to identify apicoplast proteins as drug targets for the development of novel anti-malaria agents." />

The Indian urban malaria vector Anopheles stephensi Liston was selected for deltamethrin resistance for 25 generations (F25) at larval and adult stages separately in the laboratory. There was roughly a 151-fold increase in the lethal concentration (LC)50 and a 99-fold increase in the LC90 in larval selection, when the F25 was compared with the parent colony. Similarly, adult selection resulted in a 39-fold increase in the LC50 and a 31-fold increase in the LC90 in the adults. Knockdown bioassays conducted on adults (selected at the larval and adult stages) against the diagnostic concentration of insecticide-impregnated papers, namely, deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%), lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05%), and cyfluthrin (0.15%), revealed that the adults selected at the adult stage were more resistant to deltamethrin and the other pyrethroids than those selected at the larval stage. A significant cross-resistance to DDT was noticed only in the adults selected at the adult stage, and no cross-resistance to malathion and propoxur was observed in the adults of both resistant colonies. Polymerase chain reaction studies revealed an occurrence of heterozygote level of kdr mutation (leucine to phenylalanine) in the adults selected at the adult stage. This event was not observed in the adults selected at the larval stage. Moreover, this is the first report on the occurrence of kdr mutation in Indian An. stephensi resistant to deltamethrin." />

      <html_content value="Characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum M17 leucyl aminopeptidase. A protease involved in amino acid regulation with potential for antimalarial drug development. Amino acids generated from the catabolism of hemoglobin by intra-erythrocytic malaria parasites are not only essential for protein synthesis but also function in maintaining an osmotically stable environment, and creating a gradient by which amino acids that are rare or not present in hemoglobin are drawn into the parasite from host serum. We have proposed that a Plasmodium falciparum M17 leucyl aminopeptidase (PfLAP) generates and regulates the internal pool of free amino acids and therefore represents a target for novel antimalarial drugs. This enzyme has been expressed in insect cells as a functional 320-kDa homo-hexamer that is optimally active at neutral or alkaline pH, is dependent on metal ions for activity, and exhibits a substrate preference for N-terminally exposed hydrophobic amino acids, particularly leucine. PfLAP is produced by all stages in the intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle of malaria but was most highly expressed by trophozoites, a stage at which hemoglobin degradation and parasite protein synthesis are elevated. The enzyme was located by immunohistochemical methods and by transfecting malaria cells with a PfLAP-green fluorescent protein construct, to the cytosolic compartment of the cell at all developmental stages, including segregated merozoites. Amino acid dipeptide analogs, such as bestatin and its derivatives, are potent inhibitors of the protease and also block the growth of P. falciparum malaria parasites in culture. This study provides a biochemical basis for the antimalarial activity of aminopeptidase inhibitors. Availability of functionally active recombinant PfLAP, coupled with a simple enzymatic readout, will aid medicinal chemistry and/or high throughput approaches for the future design/discovery of new antimalarial drugs." />

Parasites that cause malaria must complete a complex life cycle in Anopheles vector mosquitoes in order to be transmitted from human to human. Previous gene-silencing studies have shown the influence of mosquito immunity in controlling the development of Plasmodium. Thus, parasite survival to the oocyst stage increased when the parasite antagonist gene LRIM1 (leucine-rich repeat immune protein 1) of the mosquito was silenced, but decreased when the C-type lectin agonist gene CTL4 or CTLMA2 (CTL mannose binding 2) was silenced. However, such effects were shown for infections of the human mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae with the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. Here, we report the first results of A. gambiae gene silencing on infection by sympatric field isolates of the principal human pathogen P. falciparum. In contrast with the results obtained with the rodent parasite, silencing of the same three genes had no effect on human parasite development. These results highlight the importance of following up discoveries in laboratory model systems with studies on natural parasite-mosquito interactions." />

      <html_content value="Occurrence of the leucine-to-phenylalanine knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation in Anopheles arabiensis populations in Tanzania, detected by a simplified high-throughput SSOP-ELISA method. BACKGROUND: Molecular markers of insecticide resistance can provide sensitive indicators of resistance development in malaria vector populations. Monitoring of insecticide resistance in vector populations is an important component of current malaria control programmes. Knockdown resistance (kdr) confers resistance to the pyrethroid class of insecticides with cross-resistance to DDT through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene. METHODS: To enable detection of kdr mutations at low frequency a method was developed that uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based technology, allowing rapid, reliable and cost-effective testing of large numbers of individual mosquitoes. This was used to assay mosquitoes from sites in lower Moshi, Tanzania. RESULTS: Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) were used for simultaneous detection of both East and West African kdr mutations with high specificity and sensitivity. Application of the SSOP-ELISA method to 1,620 field-collected Anopheles arabiensis from Tanzania identified the West African leucine-phenylalanine kdr mutation in two heterozygous individuals, indicating the potential for resistance development that requires close monitoring. CONCLUSION: The presence of the West African kdr mutation at low frequency in this East African population of An. arabiensis has implications for the spread of the kdr gene across the African continent." />

      <html_content value="Identification of a novel antigen of Schistosoma mansoni shared with Plasmodium falciparum and evaluation of different cross-reactive antibody subclasses induced by human schistosomiasis and malaria. Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma mansoni are often found in human coinfections, and cross-reactive antibodies to different components of the two parasites have been detected. In this work, we identified a cross-reactive S. mansoni gene product, referred to as SmLRR, that seems to belong to the leucine-rich repeat protein family. Comparative analysis of SmLRR revealed 57% similarity with a putative gene product encoded in the P. falciparum genome. Antibodies to SmLRR were found in experimental infections and in both S. mansoni- and P. falciparum-infected individuals. Correlative analysis of human anti-SmLRR responses in Kenya and Uganda suggested that malaria and schistosomiasis drive the immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) and IgG4 isotypes, respectively, against SmLRR, suggesting that there is differential regulation of cross-reactive isotypes depending on the infection. In addition, the levels of anti-SmLRR IgG4, but not the levels of IgG3, correlated positively with the intensity of S. mansoni infection." />

We surveyed an Anopheles gambiae population in a West African malaria transmission zone for naturally occurring genetic loci that control mosquito infection with the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The strongest Plasmodium resistance loci cluster in a small region of chromosome 2L and each locus explains at least 89% of parasite-free mosquitoes in independent pedigrees. Together, the clustered loci form a genomic Plasmodium-resistance island that explains most of the genetic variation for malaria parasite infection of mosquitoes in nature. Among the candidate genes in this chromosome region, RNA interference knockdown assays confirm a role in Plasmodium resistance for Anopheles Plasmodium-responsive leucine-rich repeat 1 (APL1), encoding a leucine-rich repeat protein that is similar to molecules involved in natural pathogen resistance mechanisms in plants and mammals." />

      <html_content value="Regulation of protein phosphatase type 1 and cell cycle progression by PfLRR1, a novel leucine-rich repeat protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The protein called &apos;suppressor of the dis2 mutant (sds22+)&apos; is an essential regulator of cell division in fission and budding yeasts, where its deletion causes mitotic arrest. Its role in cell cycle control appears to be mediated through the activation of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have identified the Plasmodium falciparum Sds22 orthologue, which we designated PfLRR1 as it belongs to the leucine-rich repeat protein family. We showed by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay that the PfLRR1 gene product interacts with PfPP1, that the PfLRR1-PfPP1 complex is present in parasite extracts and that PfLRR1 inhibits PfPP1 activity. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that PfLRR1 interacted with endogenous PP1 and overcame the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint by promoting progression to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Confirmatory results showing the appearance of GVBD were observed when oocytes were treated with anti-PP1 antibodies or okadaic acid. Taken together, these observations suggest that PfLRR1 can regulate the cell cycle by binding to PP1 and regulating its activity." />

      <html_content value="Co-occurrence of East and West African kdr mutations suggests high levels of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Anopheles gambiae from Libreville, Gabon. Point mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene involved in knockdown resistance to DDT and pyrethroid insecticides have been described in several insect species. In the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae) two mutations have been identified. The first, consisting of a leucine-phenylalanine substitution at amino acid position 1014, is widespread in West Africa. The second, a leucine-serine substitution at the same position, has to date only been detected in western Kenya. Analysis of the kdr polymorphism in a sample of 106 An. gambiae s.s. of the rDNA S-form/Type I collected in Libreville (Gabon) surprisingly revealed the presence of both East and West African kdr mutations with frequencies of 63% and 37%, respectively. No wild-type alleles were detected and there was an excess of heterozygous genotypes (P = 0.04). In addition, an inconsistency was found during the kdr genotyping procedures by polymerase chain reaction, which could have lead to an underestimation of resistance alleles. The implications of these findings are discussed." />

Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is the key enzyme in purine base salvage in humans and in purine auxotrophs, including Plasmodium falciparum, the leading cause of malaria. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange into amide bonds, quantitated by on-line HPLC and mass spectrometry, has been used to compare the dynamic and conformational properties of human HGPRT alone, the HGPRT-GMP-Mg(2+) complex, the HGPRT-IMP-MgPPi &amp;lt;==&gt; HGPRT-Hx-MgPRPP equilibrating mixture, and the transition-state analogue complex HGPRT-ImmGP-MgPPi. The rate and extent of H/D exchange of 26 peptic peptides, spanning 91% of the primary structure, have been monitored. Human HGPRT has 207 amide H/D exchange sites. After 1 h in D2O, HGPRT alone exchanges 160, HGPRT-GMP-Mg(2+) exchanges 154, the equilibrium complex exchanges 139, and the transition-state analogue complex exchanges 126 of these amide protons. H/D exchange rates are correlated with structure for peptides in (1) catalytic site loops, (2) a connected peptide of the subunit interface of the tetramer, and (3) a loop buried in the catalytic site. Structural properties related to H/D exchange are defined from crystallographic studies of the HGPRT-GMP-Mg(2+) and HGPRT-ImmGP-MgPPi complexes. Transition-state analogue binding strengthens the interaction between subunits and tightens the catalytic site loops. The solvent exchange dynamics in specific peptides correlates with hydrogen bond patterns, solvent access, crystallographic B-factors, and ligand exchange rates. Solvent exchange reveals loop dynamics in the free enzyme, Michaelis complexes, and the complex with the bound transition-state analogue. Proton transfer paths, rather than dynamic motion, are required to explain exchange into a buried catalytic site peptide in the complex with the bound transition-state analogue." />

The viability of ring forms of P. falciparum, measured by [3H]hypoxanthine and [14C]isoleucine uptake, was significantly reduced within 5 h of exposure to 2.5 microM rifampicin, the 50% inhibitory concentration. Streptolydigin and tagetitoxin, other specific inhibitors of bacterial RNA polymerase, were much less effective as antimalarials. A rifampicin-tolerant sub-line of P. falciparum was selected in vitro. When released from drug pressure, the tolerant line showed appreciably greater rates of incorporation of precursors and growth than the parent line, but over a period of months these characteristics gradually reverted. Rifampicin was effective against a chloroquine-resistant line of P. falciparum and the rifampicin-tolerant line had increased chloroquine sensitivity. Treatment of patent parasitaemias of P. chabaudi in mice with more than 100 mg/kg rifampicin twice daily significantly reduced the parasitaemia within 24 h and parasites were barely detectable on blood films by the fourth day. Recrudescence occurred on release of drug pressure." />

      <html_content value="Differential effects of chloroquine on the phospholipid metabolism of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes. The effect of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) on the phospholipid metabolism in Plasmodium knowlesi-infected simian erythrocytes has been studied by incubating cells with different labeled precursors and various concentrations of CQ. The drug induced considerable modifications of this metabolism but at the same time decreased nucleic acid and protein synthesis as well as the output of 14CO2 from radioactive glucose. Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was severely reduced. However, under these conditions, CQ had the early effect of markedly increasing phosphatidylinositol labeling from radioactive inositol, fatty acids, 1-(14C)palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, but not from glycerol. Synthesis of phosphatidylserine from (14C)serine and of phosphatidylethanolamine from labeled glycerol, ethanolamine, and serine was increased, especially at high CQ concentrations when the whole metabolism of the parasite was severely reduced. These effects reflect a deep differential effect of CQ on the intense phospholipid metabolism of the Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes, which might involve a redirecting of phospholipid metabolism similar to that induced by other cationic amphiphilic drugs, and a compensatory synthesis resulting from the severe blockage of phosphatidylcholine synthesis." />

Merozoite surface proteins of Plasmodium falciparum play a critical role in the invasion of human erythrocytes by the malaria parasite. Here we describe the identification of a novel protein with a molecular mass of 40 kDa that is found on the merozoite surface of P. falciparum. We call this protein merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP-4). Evidence for the surface location of MSP-4 includes (i) a staining pattern that is consistent with merozoite surface location in indirect immunofluorescent studies of cultured parasites, (ii) localization of MSP-4 in the detergent phase in Triton X-114 partitioning studies, and (iii) nucleotide sequencing studies which predict the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence and a hydrophobic C-terminal sequence in the protein. Immunoprecipitation studies of biosynthetically labelled parasites with [3H] myristic acid indicated that MSP-4 is anchored on the merozoite surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. Of considerable interest is the presence of a single epidermal growth factor-like domain at the C terminus of the MSP-4 protein, making it the second protein with such a structure to be found on the merozoite surface." />

      <html_content value="Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum choline kinase by hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide: a possible antimalarial mechanism. Choline kinase is the first enzyme in the Kennedy pathway (CDP-choline pathway) for the biosynthesis of the most essential phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, in Plasmodium falciparum. In addition, choline kinase also plays a pivotal role in trapping essential polar head group choline inside the malaria parasite. Recently, Plasmodium falciparum choline kinase (PfCK) has been cloned, overexpressed, and purified. However, the function of this enzyme in parasite growth and survival has not been evaluated owing to the lack of a suitable inhibitor. Purified recombinant PfCK enabled us to identify an inhibitor of PfCK, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTAB), which has a very close structural resemblance to hexadecylphosphocholine (miltefosin), the well-known antiproliferative and antileishmanial drug. HDTAB inhibited PfCK in a dose-dependent manner and offered very potent antimalarial activity in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum. Moreover, HDTAB exhibited profound antimalarial activity in vivo against the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii (N-67 strain). Interestingly, parasites at the trophozoite and schizont stages were found to be particularly sensitive to HDTAB. The stage-specific antimalarial effect of HDTAB correlated well with the expression pattern of PfCK in P. falciparum, which was observed by reverse transcription-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the antimalarial activity of HDTAB paralleled the decrease in phosphatidylcholine content, which was found to correlate with the decreased phosphocholine generation. These results suggest that inhibition of choline kinase by HDTAB leads to decreased phosphocholine, which in turn causes a decrease in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, resulting in death of the parasite." />

      <html_content value="Connections between single-cell biomechanics and human disease states: gastrointestinal cancer and malaria. We investigate connections between single-cell mechanical properties and subcellular structural reorganization from biochemical factors in the context of two distinctly different human diseases: gastrointestinal tumor and malaria. Although the cell lineages and the biochemical links to pathogenesis are vastly different in these two cases, we compare and contrast chemomechanical pathways whereby intracellular structural rearrangements lead to global changes in mechanical deformability of the cell. This single-cell biomechanical response, in turn, seems to mediate cell mobility and thereby facilitates disease progression in situations where the elastic modulus increases or decreases due to membrane or cytoskeleton reorganization. We first present new experiments on elastic response and energy dissipation under repeated tensile loading of epithelial pancreatic cancer cells in force- or displacement-control. Energy dissipation from repeated stretching significantly increases and the cell&apos;s elastic modulus decreases after treatment of Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells with sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a bioactive lipid that influences cancer metastasis. When the cell is treated instead with lysophosphatidic acid, which facilitates actin stress fiber formation, neither energy dissipation nor modulus is noticeably affected. Integrating recent studies with our new observations, we ascribe these trends to possible SPC-induced reorganization primarily of keratin network to perinuclear region of cell; the intermediate filament fraction of the cytoskeleton thus appears to dominate deformability of the epithelial cell. Possible consequences of these results to cell mobility and cancer metastasis are postulated. We then turn attention to progressive changes in mechanical properties of the human red blood cell (RBC) infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We present, for the first time, continuous force-displacement curves obtained from in-vitro deformation of RBC with optical tweezers for different intracellular developmental stages of parasite. The shear modulus of RBC is found to increase up to 10-fold during parasite development, which is a noticeably greater effect than that from prior estimates. By integrating our new experimental results with published literature on deformability of Plasmodium-harbouring RBC, we examine the biochemical conditions mediating increases or decreases in modulus, and their implications for disease progression. Some general perspectives on connections among structure, single-cell mechanical properties and biological responses associated with pathogenic processes are also provided in the context of the two diseases considered in this work." />

Generation of phosphocholine by choline kinase is important for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via Kennedy pathway and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis is essential for intraerythrocytic growth of malaria parasite. A putative gene (Gene ID PF14_0020) in chromosome 14, having highest sequence homology with choline kinase, has been identified by BLAST searches from P. falciparum genome sequence database. This gene has been PCR amplified, cloned, over-expressed and characterized. Choline kinase activity of the recombinant protein (PfCK) was validated as it catalyzed the formation of phosphocholine from choline in presence of ATP. The K(m) values for choline and ATP are found to be 145+/-20 microM and 2.5+/-0.3 mM, respectively. PfCK can phosphorylate choline efficiently but not ethanolamine. Southern blotting indicates that PfCK is a single copy gene and it is a cytosolic protein as evidenced by Western immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. A model structure of PfCK was constructed based on the crystal structure of choline kinase of C. elegans to search the structural homology. Consistent with the homology modeling predictions, CD analysis indicates that the alpha and beta content of PfCK are 33% and 14%, respectively. Since choline kinase plays a vital role for growth and multiplication of P. falciparum during intraerythrocytic stages, we can suggest that this well characterized PfCK may be exploited in the screening of new choline kinase inhibitors to evaluate their antimalarial activity." />

      <html_content value="In vivo evidence for the specificity of Plasmodium falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase and its coupling to the Kennedy pathway. Unlike humans and yeast, Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of the most severe form of human malaria, utilizes host serine as a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via a plant-like pathway involving phosphoethanolamine methylation. The monopartite phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, Pfpmt, plays an important role in the biosynthetic pathway of this major phospholipid by providing the precursor phosphocholine via a three-step S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation of phosphoethanolamine. In vitro studies showed that Pfpmt has strong specificity for phosphoethanolamine. However, the in vivo substrate (phosphoethanolamine or phosphatidylethanolamine) is not yet known. We used yeast as a surrogate system to express Pfpmt and provide genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrating the specificity of Pfpmt for phosphoethanolamine in vivo. Wild-type yeast cells, which inherently lack phosphoethanolamine methylation, acquire this activity as a result of expression of Pfpmt. The Pfpmt restores the ability of a yeast mutant pem1Deltapem2Delta lacking the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase genes to grow in the absence of choline. Lipid analysis of the Pfpmt-complemented pem1Deltapem2Delta strain demonstrates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine but not the intermediates of phosphatidylethanolamine transmethylation. Complementation of the pem1Deltapem2Delta mutant relies on specific methylation of phosphoethanolamine but not phosphatidylethanolamine. Interestingly, a mutation in the yeast choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase gene abrogates the complementation by Pfpmt thus demonstrating that Pfpmt activity is directly coupled to the Kennedy pathway for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine." />

      <html_content value="A pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in Plasmodium falciparum involving phosphoethanolamine methylation. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The rapid multiplication of the parasite within human erythrocytes requires an active production of new membranes. Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in Plasmodium membranes, and the pathways leading to its synthesis are attractive targets for chemotherapy. In addition to its synthesis from choline, phosphatidylcholine is synthesized from serine via an unknown pathway. Serine, which is actively transported by Plasmodium from human serum and readily available in the parasite, is subsequently converted into phosphoethanolamine. Here, we describe in P. falciparum a plant-like S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent three-step methylation reaction that converts phosphoethanolamine into phosphocholine, a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. We have identified the gene, PfPMT, encoding this activity and shown that its product is an unusual phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase with no human homologs. P. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (Pfpmt) is a monopartite enzyme with a single catalytic domain that is responsible for the three-step methylation reaction. Interestingly, Pfpmt activity is inhibited by its product phosphocholine and by the phosphocholine analog, miltefosine. We show that miltefosine can also inhibit parasite proliferation within human erythrocytes. The importance of this enzyme in P. falciparum membrane biogenesis makes it a potential target for malaria chemotherapy." />

Sphingolipid metabolism and metabolites are important in various cellular events in eukaryotes. However, little is known about their function in plasmodial parasites. Here we demonstrate that neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) involved in the sphingomyelin (SM) catabolism is retained by the intraerythrocytic parasite Plasmodium falciparum. When assayed in a neutral pH buffer supplemented with Mg(2+) and phosphatidylserine, an activity for the release of the phosphocholine group from SM was detected in parasite-infected, but not in uninfected, erythrocyte ghosts. The SMase activity in the parasite-infected erythrocyte ghosts was enhanced markedly by anionic phospholipids including unsaturated but not saturated phosphatidylserine. Mn(2+) could not substitute for Mg(2+) to activate SMase in parasite-infected erythrocyte ghosts, whereas both Mn(2+) and Mg(2+) activated mammalian neutral SMase. The specific activity level of SMase was higher in isolated parasites than in infected erythrocyte ghosts; further fractionation of lysates of the isolated parasites showed that the activity was bound largely to the membrane fraction of the parasites. The plasmodial SMase seemed not to hydrolyse phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylinositol. The plasmodial SMase, but not SM synthase, was sensitive to scyphostatin, an inhibitor of mammalian neutral SMase, indicating that the plasmodial activities for SM hydrolysis and SM synthesis are mediated by different catalysts. Our finding that the malaria parasites possess SMase activity might explain why the parasites seem to have an SM synthase activity but no activity to synthesize ceramide de novo." />

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is the rate-limiting and regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the major membrane phospholipid, in Plasmodium. The structural gene encoding CCT was isolated from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This was achieved using the PCR to amplify genomic DNA with degenerate primers constructed on the basis of conserved regions identified within yeast and rat liver CCT molecules, and using the PCR product to screen a genomic library. The P. falciparum CCT gene encodes a protein of 370 amino acids (42. 6 kDa) and displays 41-43% similarity (28-29% identity) to CCT molecules of the other organisms cloned to date. The central domain of CCT, proposed as the catalytic domain of the CTP-transfer reaction, shows 68-72% similarity and 48-55% identity among P. falciparum, human, rat and yeast enzymes. This gene is present in a single copy, as determined by Southern-blotting of genomic DNA, and located on chromosome 13 of P. falciparum. Large transcripts were detected by Northern analysis and indicate that this gene is expressed in the asexual intraerythrocytic stages. The coding region of the P. falciparum CCT gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector to confirm the function of the CCT product. The recombinant CCT expressed in E. coli is catalytically active, as evidenced by the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline." />

Palmitoyl and decanoyl analogues of 1-phenyl-2-acylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol inhibit the enzyme activity in infected erythrocytes. An average of 35% of the activity is extremely sensitive to these drugs and undergoes a rapid, linear decrease at drug concentrations of 0.05-1 microM. The remaining 65% suffers a slower linear inhibition at drug concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 microM. Evidence is presented that inhibition of the sensitive fraction alone selectively disrupts the appearance of the interconnected tubular network in the host cell cytoplasm, without blocking secretory development at the parasite plasma membrane or in organelles within the parasite, such as the Golgi and the digestive food vacuole. This inhibition also blocks parasite proliferation in culture, indicating that the sensitive sphingomyelin synthase activity as well as the tubovesicular network may provide rational targets for drugs against malaria." />

Plasmodium falciparum is an intracellular parasite of human erythrocytes. Parasite development is accompanied by an increase of the phospholipid content of the infected erythrocyte, but it results in a selective decrease of sphingomyelin. We have studied sphingomyelin biosynthesis in infected erythrocytes using as substrate a synthetic radiolabelled ceramide precursor, truncated in both hydrophobic chains. Lysates of infected, unlike those of non-infected, erythrocytes contained sphingomyelin synthase activity, which therefore is of parasite origin. The enzyme activity was associated with a membrane fraction. In contrast to mammalian cells, the parasite did not synthesize detectable levels of glycosphingolipids. In intact infected erythrocytes the ceramide precursor was converted into a correspondingly truncated soluble sphingomyelin which was released into the medium at 37 degrees C. Release of truncated sphingomyelin was inhibited by low temperature (15 degrees C) but not by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A which, however, arrests protein export from the parasite. While membranes of mammalian cells, including the plasma membrane of non-infected erythrocytes, are impermeable to truncated sphingomyelin, the membrane of infected erythrocytes allowed passage of the molecule in both directions. The results obtained with the unicellular eukaryote used here as an experimental model are discussed in comparison with sphingomyelin synthesis and transport in mammalian cells." />

This work describes two unusual features of membrane development in a eukaryotic cell.

(b) The stage-specific export of sphingomyelin synthase, a biosynthetic activity concentrated in the Golgi of mammalian cells, to this tubovesicular network. Evidence is presented that in the extracellular merozoite stage the parasite retains sphingomyelin synthase within its plasma membrane. However, intracellular ring- and trophozoite-stage parasites export a substantial fraction (approximately 26%) of sphingomyelin synthase activity to membranes beyond their plasma membrane. Importantly we do not observe synthesis of new enzyme during these intracellular stages. Taken together these results strongly suggest that the export of this classic Golgi enzyme is developmentally regulated in Plasmodium. We discuss the significance of this export and the tubovesicular network with respect to membrane development and function in the erythrocyte cytosol." />

The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is an important vector for malaria, which is one of the most serious human parasitic diseases in the world, causing up to 2.7 million deaths yearly. To contribute to our understanding of A. gambiae and to the transmission of malaria, we have now cloned four evolutionarily related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from this mosquito and expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary cells. After screening of a library of thirty-three insect or other invertebrate neuropeptides and eight biogenic amines, we could identify (de-orphanize) three of these GPCRs as: an adipokinetic hormone (AKH) receptor (EC(50) for A. gambiae AKH, 3x10(-9)M), a corazonin receptor (EC(50) for A. gambiae corazonin, 4x10(-9)M), and a crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) receptor (EC(50) for A. gambiae CCAP, 1x10(-9)M). The fourth GPCR remained an orphan, although its close evolutionary relationship to the A. gambiae and other insect AKH receptors suggested that it is a receptor for an AKH-like peptide. This is the first published report on evolutionarily related AKH, corazonin, and CCAP receptors in mosquitoes." />

      <html_content value="Truncation of merozoite surface protein 3 disrupts its trafficking and that of acidic-basic repeat protein to the surface of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites. Merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3), an important vaccine candidate, is a soluble polymorphic antigen associated with the surface of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites. The MSP3 sequence contains three blocks of heptad repeats that are consistent with the formation of an intramolecular coiled-coil. MSP3 also contains a glutamic acid-rich region and a putative leucine zipper sequence at the C-terminus. We have disrupted the msp3 gene by homologous recombination, resulting in the expression of a truncated form of MSP3 that lacks the putative leucine zipper sequence but retains the glutamic acid-rich region and the heptad repeats. Here, we show that truncated MSP3, lacking the putative leucine zipper region, does not localize to the parasitophorous vacuole or interact with the merozoite surface. Furthermore, the acidic-basic repeat antigen (ABRA), which is present on the merozoite surface, also was not localized to the merozoite surface in parasites expressing the truncated form of MSP3. The P. falciparum merozoites lacking MSP3 and ABRA on the surface show reduced invasion into erythrocytes. These results suggest that MSP3 is not absolutely essential for blood stage growth and that the putative leucine zipper region is required for the trafficking of both MSP3 and ABRA to the parasitophorous vacuole." />

      <html_content value="Plasma glutamine and glutamate concentrations in Gabonese children with Plasmodium falciparum infection. BACKGROUND: Low plasma glutamine levels in critical illness, neonates and burns patients are associated with poor outcome and increased risk of intercurrent infection. AIM: To investigate the relationship between plasma glutamine/glutamate levels and severity/outcome of malaria. DESIGN: Two-hospital prospective study, with both febrile and healthy controls. METHODS: We measured plasma glutamine and glutamate concentrations in 239 Gabonese patients: 145 children with malaria (86 with severe, 36 with moderate and 23 with uncomplicated disease), 42 healthy children, 44 febrile controls and eight healthy adults, and related findings to conventional markers of disease severity such as plasma lactate. RESULTS: Median (IQR) plasma glutamine was lower in uncomplicated falciparum malaria and in moderate malaria than in healthy controls: 353 (287-474) and 379 (293-448) vs. 485 (428-531) micromol/l, respectively; p&amp;lt;0.01 for both malaria groups vs. controls. In contrast, plasma glutamine was within the normal range in those with severe malaria and in febrile control children: 431 (342-525) and 472 (338-547) micromol/l, respectively. Furthermore, plasma glutamine was significantly higher in the children who died with malaria than in survivors: 514 (374-813) (n=12) vs. 399 (316-475) micromol/l (n=133), respectively; p=0.001. There were no significant differences in plasma glutamate concentrations between any of the study groups. DISCUSSION: In severe malaria, there was a positive correlation between plasma glutamine and lactate levels (p=0.009, r=0.281). This correlation may reflect impaired gluconeogenesis. Glutamine supplementation is probably not justified in severe P. falciparum infection." />

      <html_content value="CD8(+)-T-cell depletion ameliorates circulatory shock in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice. The Plasmodium berghei-infected mouse model is a well-recognized model for human cerebral malaria. Mice infected with P. berghei exhibit (i) metabolic acidosis (pH &amp;lt; 7.3) associated with elevated plasma lactate concentrations, (ii) significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) vascular leakage in their lungs, hearts, kidneys, and brains, (ii) significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) higher cell and serum glutamate concentrations, and (iv) significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) lower mean arterial blood pressures. Because these complications are similar to those of septic shock, the simplest interpretation of these findings is that the mice develop shock brought on by the P. berghei infection. To determine whether the immune system and specifically CD8(+) T cells mediate the key features of shock during P. berghei malaria, we depleted CD8(+) T cells by monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment and assessed the complications of malarial shock. P. berghei-infected mice depleted of CD8(+) T cells by mAb treatment had significantly reduced vascular leakage in their hearts, brains, lungs, and kidneys compared with infected controls treated with rat immunoglobulin G. CD8-depleted mice were significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) protected from lactic acidosis, glutamate buildup, and diminished HCO(3)(-) levels. Although the blood pressure decreased in anti-CD8 mAb-treated mice infected with P. berghei, the cardiac output, as assessed by echocardiography, was similar to that of uninfected control mice. Collectively, our results indicate that (i) pathogenesis similar to septic shock occurs during experimental P. berghei malaria, (ii) respiratory distress with lactic acidosis occurs during P. berghei malaria, and (iii) most components of circulatory shock are ameliorated by depletion of CD8(+) T cells." />

A complex of non-covalently bound polypeptides is located on the surface of the merozoite form of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Four of these polypeptides are derived by proteolytic processing of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) precursor. Two components, a 22 and a 36 kDa polypeptide are not derived from MSP-1. The N-terminal sequence of the 36 kDa polypeptide has been determined, the corresponding gene cloned, and the protein characterised. The 36 kDa protein consists of 211 amino acids and is derived from a larger precursor of 371 amino acids. The precursor merozoite surface protein 6 (MSP-6) has been designated, and the 36 kDa protein, MSP-6(36). Mass spectrometric analysis of peptides released from the polypeptide by tryptic digestion confirmed that the gene identified codes for MSP-6(36). Antibodies were produced to a recombinant protein containing the C-terminal 45 amino acid residues of MSP-6(36). In immunofluorescence studies these antibodies bound to antigen at the parasite surface or in the parasitophorous vacuole within schizonts, with a pattern indistinguishable from that of antibodies to MSP-1. MSP-6(36) was present in the MSP-1 complex immunoprecipitated from the supernatant of in vitro parasite cultures, but was also immunoprecipitated from this supernatant in a form not bound to MSP-1. Examination of the MSP-6 gene in three parasite lines detected no sequence variation. The sequence of MSP-6(36) is related to that of the previously described merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP-3). The MSP-6(36) amino acid sequence has 50% identity and 85% similarity with the C-terminal region of MSP-3. The proteins share a specific sequence pattern (ILGWEFGGG-[AV]-P) and a glutamic acid-rich region. The remainder of MSP-6 and MSP-3 are unrelated, except at the N-terminus. Both MSP-6(36) and MSP-3 are partially associated with the parasite surface and partially released as soluble proteins on merozoite release. MSP-6(36) is a hydrophilic negatively charged polypeptide, but there are two clusters of hydrophobic amino acids at the C-terminus, located in two amphipathic helical structures identified from secondary structure predictions. It was suggested that this 35 residue C-terminal region may be involved in MSP-6(36) binding to MSP-1 or other molecules; alternatively, based on the secondary structure and coil formation predictions, the region may form an intramolecular anti-parallel coiled-coil structure." />

      <html_content value="Sexual stage-specific expression of a third calcium-dependent protein kinase from Plasmodium falciparum. A third calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) gene has been isolated from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum by vectorette technology. The gene consists of five exons and four introns. The open reading frame resulting from removal of the four introns encodes a protein of 562 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 65.3 kDa. The encoded protein, termed PfCDPK3, consists of four distinct domains characteristic of a member of the CDPK family and displays the highest homology (46% identity and 69% similarity) to PfCDPK2, the second CDPK of P. falciparum. The N-terminal variable domain is rich in serine/threonine and lysine and contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for a range of protein kinases. The catalytic domain possesses all conserved motifs of the protein kinase family except for the highly conserved glutamic acid residue in subdomain VIII, which is replaced by a glutamine residue. The sequence of the junction domain comprising 31 amino acid residues is less conserved. The calmodulin-like regulatory domain contains four EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, each consisting of a loop of 12 amino acid residues which is flanked by two alpha-helices. Southern blotting of genomic DNA digests showed that the Pfcdpk3 gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome. A 2900 nucleotide transcript of this gene is expressed specifically in the sexual erythrocytic stage, indicating that PfCDPK3 is involved in sexual stage-specific events. It is proposed that PfCDPK3 may serve as a link between calcium and gametogenesis of P. falciparum." />

The malarial parasite dramatically affects the structure and function of the erythrocyte membrane by exporting proteins that specifically interact with the host membrane. This report describes the complete sequence and some biochemical properties of a 93-kDa Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi protein that interacts with the host erythrocyte membrane. Approximately 40% of the deduced protein sequence consists of tandem repeats of 14 amino acids that are rich in glutamic acid residues. Comparison of the repeat sequences from two different P. c. chabaudi strains derived from the same initial isolate revealed an exact duplication of 294 nucleotides suggesting a recent unequal crossing-over event. However, in spite of this potentially high level of intragenic recombination activity, the repeat sequences from P. c. adami are rather conserved suggesting structural or functional constraints on the protein and tandem repeats. The 93-kDa protein exists in an oligomeric form as revealed by gel filtration chromatography and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. A predominantly alpha-helical predicted secondary structure and a discrepancy between the estimated molecular sizes determined from non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography suggest that the protein is a long rod-shaped or fibrillar, protein. Attributes shared between the 93-kDa protein, some P. falciparum proteins with glutamate-rich tandem repeats, and cytoskeletal proteins suggest that these parasite proteins function as cytoskeletal proteins that possibly stabilize the erythrocyte membrane." />

      <html_content value="Dramatic changes in oxidative tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway in experimental cerebral and noncerebral malaria. The pathogenesis of human cerebral malaria (CM) remains unresolved. In the most widely used murine model of CM, the presence of T lymphocytes and/or interferon (IFN)-gamma is a prerequisite. IFN-gamma is the key inducer of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which is the catalyst of the first, and rate-limiting, step in the metabolism of tryptophan (Trp) along the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway. Quinolinic acid (QA), a product of this pathway, is a neuro-excitotoxin, like glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp). Kynurenic acid (KA), also produced from the Kyn pathway, antagonizes the neuro-excitotoxic effects of QA, Glu, and Asp. We therefore examined the possible roles of IDO, metabolites of the Kyn pathway, Glu, and Asp in the pathogenesis of fatal murine CM. Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection was studied on days 6 and 7 post-inoculation (p.i.), at which time the mice exhibited cerebral symptoms such as convulsions, ataxia, coma, and a positive Wooly/White sign and died within 24 hours. A model for noncerebral malaria (NCM), P. berghei K173 infection, was also studied on days 6 and 7 and 13 to 17 p.i. to examine whether any changes were a general response to malaria infection. Biochemical analyses were done by high-pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). IDO activity was low or absent in the brains of uninfected mice and NCM mice (days 6 and 7 p.i.) and was induced strongly in the brains of fatal murine CM mice (days 6 and 7 p.i.) and NCM animals (days 13 to 17 p.i.). This induction was inhibited greatly by administration of dexamethasone, a treatment that also prevented CM symptoms and death. Furthermore, IDO induction was absent in IFN-gamma gene knockout mice, which were also resistant to CM. Brain concentrations of Kyn, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and the neuro-excitotoxin QA were significantly increased in both CM mice on days 6 and 7 p.i. and NCM mice on days 13 to 17 p.i., whereas an increase in the ratio of brain QA to KA occurred only in the CM mice at the time they were exhibiting cerebral symptoms. Brain concentrations of Glu and Asp were significantly decreased in CM and NCM mice (days 13 to 17 p.i.). The results imply that neuro-excitation induced by QA may contribute to the convulsions and neuro-excitatory signs observed in CM." />

Ammonia and lactate levels showed significant increase with rise in parasitaemia except in spleen where decrease in the lactate levels was observed. The glutamate level displayed a marked decrease in blood, liver and splenic tissues, whereas, significant increase in glutamate level in kidney was observed, although its level in cerebral tissue remained unaltered. The pyruvate level in blood and liver showed a noticeable decrease but brain, spleen and kidney registered an elevation of the same due to the parasitic infection.

The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exports an interconnected network of tubovesicular membranes (the TVM) that extends from the parasite&apos;s vacuolar membrane to the periphery of the red cell. Here it is shown that extracellular solutes such as Lucifer yellow enter the TVM and are delivered to the parasite. Blocking the assembly of the network blocked the delivery of exogenous Lucifer yellow, nucleosides, and amino acids to the parasite without inhibiting secretion of plasmodial proteins. These data suggest that the TVM is a transport network that allows nutrients efficient access to the parasite and could be used to deliver antimalarial drugs directly into the parasite." />

The immunogenicity of a 93-kDa Plasmodium chabaudi protein that contains glutamate-rich tandem repeats was investigated in this study. Immunoblotting with various monoclonal antibodies indicates that this 93-kDa protein is equivalent to a potential P. chabaudi RESA analogue. However, the sequence of the P. chabaudi protein does not exhibit any significant homology to Pf155/RESA. Antibodies against the 93-kDa protein appear early during P. chabaudi infection and reach high titers. The highest antibody titers are found when the parasitemia is descending, suggesting that this protein may play some role in immunity. Immunization of mice with the recombinant protein also results in high antibody titers, indicating that the protein is quite immunogenic. However, mice immunized with recombinant protein and challenged with P. chabaudi do not exhibit a delayed appearance of parasitemia, a reduced parasitemia, or a shortened duration of parasitemia. Glutamate-rich P. falciparum proteins such as Pf155/RESA, are being considered as vaccine candidates. The studies with P. chabaudi suggest that interpretation of serological data using glutamate-rich proteins should proceed with caution. The glutamate-rich repeats, although highly immunogenic, may not be important in host immunity against malaria. However, antibodies that appear late in the P. chabaudi infection do appear to play a role in anti-malarial immunity." />

Synthetic P. falciparum peptides were evaluated as tools in epidemiological investigations of malaria.

IgG and IgM reactivities to the peptides increased with malaria endemicity, although there were no differences in reactivities to the GLURP peptide between non-exposed donors and donors living in areas of low malaria endemicity. IgG reactivities to the GLURP peptide in Sudanese adults were high one month after treatment in all adults tested, while IgG reactivities to the ABRA peptide were infrequent. IgM responses to the peptides tested were shortlived in most patients. In Gambian children with malaria, IgM reactivities but not IgG antibody reactivities against the ABRA peptide were higher in those with mild malaria than in those with severe malaria. The peptides may be useful in future epidemiological studies, especially in areas of low malaria endemicity." />

      <html_content value="Glutamate dehydrogenase, the marker protein of Plasmodium falciparum--cloning, expression and characterization of the malarial enzyme. The gene of an NADP+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase was cloned from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria. Southern-blot analysis indicates a single-copy gene. The gene encodes a protein with 470 residues which has 50% of all residues identical with those of the glutamate dehydrogenases from other low eukaryotes and eubacteria. In contrast, the sequence identity with the human enzyme is marginal, which underlines the long evolutionary distance between parasite and host. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme are in good agreement with those of the authentic enzyme. The parasite enzyme is inhibited by D-glutamate and glutarate, but not by chloroquine. Like other coenzyme-specific glutamate dehydrogenases, but in contrast to the dual-specific mammalian enzymes, the P. falciparum enzyme is not affected by GTP and ADP. The physical and chemical properties of the protein are in accordance with the cytosol being the major localization. The gene does not encode a cleavable mitochondrial presequence and the Mr of the recombinant protein and the protein isolated from the parasite are indistinguishable on SDS/PAGE. Western-blot analysis of stage-specific parasites shows that glutamate dehydrogenase is present in all intraerythrocytic stages. The signal increased continuously from rings, early trophozoites to late trophozoites and decreased slightly in the segmenter stage. Glutamate dehydrogenase, suggested to be the major source of NADPH in the parasite, is an attractive target molecule for the rational development of new antimalarial drugs." />

Plasmodium falciparum invades erythrocytes via several routes using different red blood cell receptors that include glycophorin A (GYPA) and glycophorin B (GYPB). GYPA has two codominant alleles, i.e., M and N, that correspond to the M and N antigens, which differ by two amino acids (S1L, G5E); the codominant alleles of GYPB, i.e., S and s, correspond to the S and s antigens, which differ by a single amino acid (T29M). If these antigens influence the efficiency of erythrocyte invasion by malaria parasites, the MNSs phenotype may be associated with the severity of malaria. To examine this, the GYPA and GYPB genotypes carrying the MNSs antigens were analyzed in 109 and 203 Thai patients with cerebral malaria and mild malaria, respectively. Neither the genotype nor allele frequencies at each locus were statistically different between the cerebral and mild malaria patients. Thus, we conclude that the MNSs antigens do not reveal the difference in susceptibility to cerebral malaria." />

      <html_content value="Assessment and Continued Validation of the MSF Assay for Use in Malaria Drug Screening. Several new fluorescent malaria in vitro drug susceptibility microtiter plate assays that detect the presence of malarial DNA in infected erythrocytes have recently been reported, in contrast to traditional isotopic screens that involve radioactive substrate incorporation to measure in vitro malaria growth inhibition. We have assessed and further characterized the malaria SYBR Green I- based fluorescence (MSF) assay for its ability to monitor drug resistance. In order to use the MSF assay as a drug screen, all assay conditions must be thoroughly examined. In this study we expanded upon the capabilities of this assay by including antibiotics and antifolates in the drug panel and testing folic acid-free growth conditions. To do this, we evaluated a more expansive panel of antimalarials in combination with various drug assay culture conditions commonly used in drug sensitivity screening for their activity against Plasmodium falciparum strains D6 and W2. The detection and quantitation limits of the MSF assay were 0.04-0.08% and approximately 0.5% parasitemia, respectively. The MSF assay quality was significantly robust, displaying a Z range of 0.73-0.95. The IC50s for each drug and culture condition combination were determined using the MSF assay. Compared to the standard [(3)H]hypoxanthine assay, the MSF assay displayed the expected parasite drug resistance patterns with a high degree of global and phenotypic correlation (r(2) &gt;/= 0.9238), regardless of which culture condition combination was used. In conclusion, the MSF assay allows for reliable one-plate high-throughput, automated malaria in vitro susceptibility testing without the expense, time consumption, and hazard of other screening assays." />

We assessed the relation between gametocyte density and mosquito infection under experimental and field conditions using real-time quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) for gametocyte quantification. Serial dilutions of NF54 P. falciparum gametocytes showed a positive association between gametocyte density and the proportion of infected mosquitoes (beta = 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-9.6; P = 0.001). Successful infection became unlikely below an estimated density of 250-300 gametocytes/mL. In the field, blood samples of 100 naturally infected children showed a positive association between gametocyte density and oocyst counts in mosquitoes (beta = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.61; P = 0.002). The relative contribution to malaria transmission was similar for carriers with submicroscopic and microscopic gametocytemia. Our results show that transmission occurs efficiently at submicroscopic gametocyte densities and that carriers harboring submicroscopic gametocytemia constitute a considerable proportion of the human infectious reservoir." />

Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria are neglected diseases, which continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, killing together around 5 million people each year. Mycolic acids, the hallmark of mycobacteria, are high-molecular-weight alpha-alkyl, beta-hydroxy fatty acids. Biochemical and genetic experimental data have shown that the product of the M. tuberculosis inhA structural gene (InhA) is the primary target of isoniazid mode of action, the most prescribed anti-tubercular agent. InhA was identified as an NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP(CoA) reductase specific for long-chain enoyl thioesters and is a member of the Type II fatty acid biosynthesis system, which elongates acyl fatty acid precursors of mycolic acids. M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum enoyl reductases are targets for the development of anti-tubercular and antimalarial agents. Here we present a brief description of the mechanism of action of, and resistance to, isoniazid. In addition, data on inhibition of mycobacterial and plasmodial enoyl reductases by triclosan are presented. We also describe recent efforts to develop inhibitors of M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum enoyl reductase enzyme activity." />

      <html_content value="Antiplasmodial activities of some products from Turreanthus africanus (Meliaceae). We investigated the antiplasmodial activity of some pure compounds of Turreanthus africanus (Meliaceae), a plant that is used in traditional medicine to treat malaria in Southwest Cameroon. A phytochemical analysis of the methylene chloride: methanol (1:1) extract of the seeds of the plant yielded seven compounds. Four of them, which were oils, were subjected to in vitro bioassays on Plasmodium falciparum F 32, chloroquine sensitive strain. Compound 1 (16-oxolabda-8 (17), 12(E)-dien-15-oic acid), showed the highest antiplasmodial activity, two others (methyl-14,15-epoxylabda-8 (17), 12(E)-diene-16-oate, and turreanin A), had moderate activity and one was inactive. These findings are consistent with the use of T. africanus in the traditional treatment of P. falciparum malaria." />

      <html_content value="Structural studies on Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-1. Plasmodium vivax infection is the second most common cause of malaria throughout the world. Like other Plasmodium species, P. vivax has a large protein complex, MSP-1, located on the merozoite surface. The C-terminal MSP-1 sub-unit, MSP-1(42), is cleaved during red blood cell invasion, causing the majority of the complex to be shed and leaving only a small 15kDa sub-unit, MSP-1(19), on the merozite surface. MSP-1(19) is considered a strong vaccine candidate. We have determined the solution structure of MSP-1(19) from P. vivax using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and show that, like in other Plasmodium species, it consists of two EGF-like domains that are oriented head-to-tail. The protein has a flat, disk-like shape with a highly charged surface. When MSP-1(19) is part of the larger MSP-1(42) precursor it exists as an independent domain with no stable contacts to the rest of the sub-unit. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicate that P. vivax MSP-1(42) exists as a dimer in solution. MSP-1(19) itself is a monomer, however, 35 amino-acids immediately upstream of its N-terminus are sufficient to cause dimerization. Our data suggest that if MSP-1(42) exists as a dimer in vivo, secondary processing would cause the dissociation of two tightly linked MSP-1(19) proteins on the merozoite surface just prior to invasion." />

      <html_content value="Effect of haematinic supplementation and malaria prevention on maternal anaemia and malaria in western Kenya. Summary Objective To evaluate the effect of routine antenatal haematinic supplementation programmes and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Kenya. Methods Anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) &amp;lt;11 g/dl), severe anaemia (Hb &amp;lt;8 g/dl) and placental malaria were compared among women with known HIV status who delivered at a provincial hospital after study enrolment in the third trimester during three consecutive periods: period 1, no routine intervention (reference); period 2, routine haematinic supplementation (60 mg elementary iron three times/day, folic acid 5 mg once daily) and period 3, haematinics and IPT with SP. Results Among 3108 participants, prevalence of placental malaria, anaemia and severe anaemia postpartum was 16.7%, 53.6% and 12.7%, respectively. Compared with period 1, women in period 2 were less anaemic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval anaemia: 0.56, 0.47-0.67; severe anaemia 0.37, 0.28-0.49] and shared a similar prevalence of placental malaria (AOR 1.07, 0.86-1.32). Women in period 3 were also less anaemic (AOR anaemia: 0.43, 0.35-0.53 and severe anaemia: 0.43, 0.31-0.59), and had less placental malaria (AOR 0.56, 0.42-0.73). The effect of intervention did not differ significantly by HIV status. Conclusion The haematinic supplementation programme was associated with significant reductions in anaemia in HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative women. The subsequent introduction of IPT was associated with halving of malaria, but no additional haematological benefit over haematinics." />

Immunization of mice with subunit vaccines based on the Plasmodium yoelii 17kDa hepatocyte erythrocyte protein (PyHEP17), orthologue of Plasmodium falciparum exported protein 1 (PfExp1), induces antigen-specific immune responses and protects against sporozoite challenge. To aid in the characterization of candidate subunit vaccines based on this antigen, we have mapped the immunodominant and subdominant CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes on PyHEP17. Using a panel of 29 15-mer synthetic peptides representing the complete sequence of PyHEP17 (amino acids 1-153), and overlapping each other by 10 residues, we identified an immunogenic region between amino acids 61-85. To define the minimal CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within this region, we synthesized 25 9-mer peptides overlapping each other by one residue. We screened the capacity of the 15-mer and 9-mer peptides to be recognized by splenocytes and lymph node cells from mice immunized with PyHEP17 plasmid DNA or peptides in Freund&apos;s adjuvant, as assessed by cytokine secretion, lymphoproliferation, and cytotoxicity. The profile of response to the T cell epitopes varied depending upon the immunization regimen. Antigen-specific T cell responses were detected to three 15-mer peptides (residues 61-75, 66-80 and 71-85) representing two 10-mer epitopes mapping to residues 66-75 (LTKNKKSLRK) and 71-80 (KSLRKINVAL). IFN-gamma responses after DNA immunization predominantly mapped to two overlapping 9-mer peptides (residues 73-81 and 74-82) sharing an eight amino acid overlap (residues 74-81, RKINVALA), whereas CTL responses predominantly mapped to four 9-mer peptides (residues 61-69, 70-78, 76-84, and 84-92). In addition, a subdominant 10-mer CD8+ T cell epitope recognized by peptide immunization but not DNA immunization mapped to residues 31-40 (GKYGSQNVIK). The identification of these epitopes will allow the evaluation of delivery systems for malaria vaccine candidates as well as the delineation of protective immune mechanisms." />

      <html_content value="L-FABP is a critical host factor for successful malaria liver stage development. The malaria parasite liver stage produces tens of thousands of red cell-infectious forms within its host hepatocyte. It is thought that the vacuole-enclosed parasite completely depends on the host cell for successful development but the molecular parasite-host cell interactions underlying this remarkable growth have remained elusive. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen and a yeast overexpression system we show that UIS3, a parasite protein essential for liver stage development, interacts directly with liver-fatty acid binding protein, L-FABP. Down-regulation of L-FABP expression in hepatocytes severely impairs parasite growth and overexpression of L-FABP promotes growth. This is the first identified direct liver stage-host cell protein interaction, providing a possible explanation for the importance of UIS3 in liver infection." />

      <html_content value="Is molecular biology the best alternative for diagnosis of malaria to microscopy? A comparison between microscopy, antigen detection and molecular tests in rural Kenya and urban Tanzania. OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement of different diagnostic methods for the diagnosis and confirmation of the clinical suspicion of Plasmodium infection in children in Tanzania and Kenya. METHOD: Blood samples were collected by the finger prick method from 338 children. Blood samples were collected from 338 children with the clinical suspicion of uncomplicated malaria in health clinics in Tanzania and Kenya. The presence of Plasmodium parasites was assessed with microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and the molecular assays, quantitative nucleic acid sequence based amplification (QT-NASBA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results were compared and analysed for agreement. RESULTS: There was a high degree of agreement (88.6-100%) between RDTs or molecular tests and microscopy. In rural Kenya, with a high incidence of malaria cases, the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.94 for RDTs to 0.76 for PCR. In urban Tanzania, where there was a low incidence of cases, R for RDTs was 1.0 but only 0.25 for PCR and 0.33 for NASBA. CONCLUSION: Malaria is overestimated if the diagnosis is based solely on clinical signs. Therefore, laboratory confirmation is essential. Microscopy is a reliable method in rural areas where malaria is prevalent, but RDTs offer a good alternative with the advantage that it is an easy and rapid method. Molecular tests are more sensitive but difficult to implement in rural areas. In areas with lower incidence, molecular tests detect a significantly higher number of Plasmodium infections than RDTs or microscopy. Although implementation of molecular tools can be difficult, the prospect of an easy and cheap detection system makes them promising tools for the near future." />

In the present study, synthetic peptides (EENVEHDA)2 [(oc)2] and (DDEHVEEPTVA)2 [(un)2] of ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) of Plasmodlium filciparum were linked with palmitic acid and entrapped in immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs). The immunogenicity of the peptide(s) and mixture of peptides were studied in mice with different genetic background. Peptide(s) entrapped in ISCOMs using a low-dose immunization strategy generated high-titer as well as high-affinity antibodies. Interestingly, no genetic restriction of the immune response was observed in any of the strains studied. The IgG subclass pattern with the peptide(s) showed predominately IgG2a/2b isotypes, while with the mixed peptide formulation, (un)2-specific IgG isotype pattern showed induction of both IgG1 and IgG2a/2b isotypes. These cytophilic antibodies inhibited the ring as well as schizont stage and total parasite growth during in vitro merozoite reinvasion inhibition study. In the mixed peptide preparation, the same pattern of immune response was achieved as that of individual peptide(s) using ISCOMs delivery. Therefore, the entrapment of otherwise poorly immunogenic synthetic peptides in ISCOMs resulted in increased immunogenicity followed by strong secondary response and can be adopted for developing subunit immunogen formulation against malarial parasite." />

Unesterified fatty acids were measured in mouse erythrocytes infected either with chloroquine-susceptible (CS) or with chloroquine-resistant (CR) lines of Plasmodium berghei. This work was undertaken to identify candidates for the lipid involved in ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) polymerization. Linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In total, they increased 4-fold with CS infections and 6-fold with CR infections. Treating infected mice with chloroquine did not affect the amounts of unesterified fatty acids in erythrocytes. Of the four fatty acids, only linoleic acid increased disproportionately to the total. It increased 16-fold for the CS line and 35-fold for the CR line. The method could detect monoglycerides but they were below the limit of detection. It could not detect diglycerides, triglycerides or phospholipids. Triglycerides and phospholipids have been tested previously, however, and found to be ineffective at promoting FP polymerization. Therefore, other than linoleic acid, the lipids most likely to be involved in FP polymerization are diglycerides. We tested dilinoleolyglycerol in the present work and found it to be an effective promoter of FP polymerization. These results suggest that linoleic acid or a diglyceride containing it has the critical role of promoting FP polymerization in malaria parasites." />

      <html_content value="The biosynthesis and post-translational modification of Pbs21 an ookinete-surface protein of Plasmodium berghei. Radiolabelled methionine incorporation into synchronised Plasmodium berghei gametocytes or ookinete cultures, showed that Pbs21 is not synthesised in bloodstage parasites; synthesis was detected within three hours of induction of gametogenesis; synthesis was triggered at gametogenesis, not by fertilisation. We show native Pbs21 to be a hydrophobic membrane protein that was insensitive to cleavage by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC), but sensitive to alkaline hydroxylamine, and partially sensitive to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) and HNO2. 3H-myristic and palmitic acid, 3H-glucosamine and mannose incorporation indicated Pbs21 was acylated and glycosylated. Linkage of the acyl group was sensitive to HNO2, which released an acyl-phosphatidylinositol more hydrophobic than that released from P3 of Trypanosoma brucei. All these properties are consistent with the presence of a malaria-specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In contrast recombinant Pbs21 (rPbs21), expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells, was sensitive to both PI-PLC and GPI-PLD, consistent with the protein being modified by a different (S. frugiperda) GPI anchor. Brefeldin A blocked secretion of rPbs21 within a cytoplasmic reticular compartment. Following deletion of the putative GPI anchor addition site (amino acids 189 213), the protein was transported to the cell surface and secreted directly into the aqueous phase of the culture medium. Deletion of amino acids 205-213 disrupted Pbs21 processing, transport through the ER and distribution onto the cell surface. Deletion of amino acids 1-28 prevented transport of Pbs21 into the ER. This suggests that correct processing of the GPI anchor in the ER-Golgi network is essential for the successful secretion of the recombinant protein, which is additionally dependent upon an N-terminal secretory signal sequence." />

      <html_content value="Lipopeptide immunization without adjuvant induces potent and long-lasting B, T helper, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against a malaria liver stage antigen in mice and chimpanzees. We have employed a 26-amino-acid synthetic peptide based on Plasmodium falciparum liver stage antigen-3 to evaluate improvements in immunogenicity mediated by the inclusion of a simple lipid-conjugated amino acid during peptide synthesis. Comparative immunization by the peptide in Freund&apos;s adjuvant or by the lipopeptide in saline shows that the addition of a palmitoyl chain can dramatically increase T helper (Th) cell responses in a wide range of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II haplotypes, to the extent that responses were induced in mice otherwise unable to respond to the non-modified peptide injected with Freund&apos;s adjuvant, and that the increased immunogenicity of the lipopeptide led to high and longer lasting antibody production (studied up to 8 months). B and T cell responses induced by the lipopeptide were reactive with native parasite protein epitopes, and a lipopeptide longer than ten amino acids was endogenously processed to associate with MHC class I and elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Finally, the lipopeptide was safe and highly immunogenic in chimpanzees, whose immune system is very similar to that of humans. Our results suggest that relatively large synthetic peptides, carefully chosen from pertinent areas of proteins and incorporating a simple palmitoyl-lysine, can induce not only CTL, but also strong Th and antibody responses in genetically diverse populations. Lipopeptides engineered in this way are simple to produce and purify under GMP conditions, they are well tolerated by apes, and with the enhanced immunogenicity without the need for adjuvant that we report here, they offer a quick and relatively low-cost route to provide material for human malaria vaccination trials." />

      <html_content value="CD36 is palmitoylated on both N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. The membrane protein CD36 has been reported to carry out a wide range of potential functions, including serving as a receptor for thrombospondin, collagen, oxidized low density lipoprotein, fatty acids, anionic phospholipids, and Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitized erythrocytes. This implicates CD36 in cellular adhesion, human atherosclerotic lesion formation, lipid metabolism, and malaria. A presumed rat homolog of CD36 was previously reported to be palmitoylated. We confirmed that human CD36 is palmitoylated and identified cysteines 3, 7, 464, and 466 as the palmitoylation sites using a mutagenesis approach. This result suggests that both the N- and C-terminal tails of CD36 are cytoplasmic. Published models for the topology of CD36 have the C terminus located in the cytoplasm but differ as to whether the N terminus is cytoplasmic or extracellular. To address this question, a C-terminal truncation mutant of CD36 was made by introducing a stop codon just upstream of the C-terminal transmembrane domain. This mutant was found membrane-bound when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, indicating that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain serves as a transmembrane anchor, and thus supporting a CD36 topology with two transmembrane domains." />

      <html_content value="Monopalmitic acid-peptide conjugates induce cytotoxic T cell responses against malarial epitopes: importance of spacer amino acids. Cytolytic T cells (CTL) play a critical role in providing protection against the liver stage of malaria infection. Previous investigations have shown that induction of CTL against peptide or proteins can be achieved by attachment of lipids. In the present study, we used the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein CTL epitope (SYIPSAEKI (PL76)). This peptide with cysteine-serine (CS) as spacer amino acids was coupled to palmitic acid (PA). The same CTL epitope containing only an extra serine was linked to S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-(R)-cysteine (tripam-C). Inbred mice [(BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1] were immunized intravenously with the lipopeptides. Both types of lipopeptides induced significant CTL responses after one injection. Immunization of the monopalmitic acid-peptide conjugate intraperitoneally emulsified in Freund&apos;s complete adjuvant also induced a significant CTL response, but the magnitude was lower as compared to the intravenous route. The major advantages of the use of the simple monopalmitic acid-peptide conjugates are: (i) low costs of the fatty acid; (ii) coupling of lipid to peptide can be performed using the peptide synthesizer during standard peptide synthesis, and (iii) standard peptide methodology can be used for purification. To investigate whether a spacer amino acid sequence between the actual CTL epitope and PA is required for induction of an optimal CTL response, we prepared monopalmitic acid-peptide conjugates with different spacer amino acids. A lipopeptide without a spacer amino acid and another one containing the CS spacer sequence both induced a CTL response, whereas a lipopeptide with a serine as spacer failed to induce CTL. These results indicate that the amino acid spacer sequences influence the immunological properties of the palmitic acid-peptide conjugates." />

      <html_content value="Modification of host cell membrane lipid composition by the intra-erythrocytic human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The phospholipid and fatty acid compositions of the host infected erythrocyte plasma membrane (IEPM) have been determined for erythrocytes infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. IEPM were prepared by selective lysis of the host erythrocyte (but not of the parasite membranes) with 0.1% saponin, followed by differential centrifugation. The purity of the IEPM was determined by measuring the membrane-specific enzyme markers acetylcholinesterase, glutamate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, and by immunoelectron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies specific for human erythrocyte glycophorin A (4E7) and for a 195 kDa parasite membrane glycoprotein (Pf6 3B10.1). Both approaches demonstrated that the host erythrocyte plasma membrane preparation was free from contamination by parasite membranes. During intra-erythrocytic development of the parasite, the phospholipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane was strikingly altered. IEPM contained more phosphatidylcholine (38.7% versus 31.7%) and phosphatidylinositol (2.1% versus 0.8%) and less sphingomyelin (14.6% versus 28.0%) than normal uninfected erythrocytes. Similar alterations in phospholipid composition were determined for erythrocyte membranes of parasitized cells isolated by an alternative method utilizing polycationic polyacrylamide microbeads (Affigel 731). The total fatty acid compositions of the major phospholipids in IEPM were determined by g.l.c. The percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids in normal erythrocyte phospholipids (39.4%) was much higher than in phospholipids from purified parasites (23.3%) or IEPM (24.0%). The unsaturation index of phospholipids in IEPM was considerably lower than in uninfected erythrocytes (107.5 versus 161.0) and was very similar to that in purified parasites (107.5 versus 98.5). Large increases in palmitic acid (C16:0) (from 21.88% to 31.21%) and in oleic acid (C18:1) (from 14.64% to 24.60%), and major decreases in arachidonic acid (C20:4) (from 17.36% to 7.85%) and in docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) (from 4.34% to 1.8%) occurred as a result of infection. The fatty acid profiles of individual phospholipid classes from IEPM resembled in many instances the fatty acid profiles of parasite phospholipids rather than those of uninfected erythrocytes. Analysis of IEPM from P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (trophozoite stage) revealed that, during intra-erythrocytic maturation of the parasite, the host erythrocyte phospholipid composition was markedly refashioned. These alterations were not dependent on the method used to isolate the IEPM, with similar results obtained using either a saponin-lysis method or binding to Affigel beads. Since mature erythrocytes have negligible lipid synthesis and metabolism, these alterations must occur as a result of parasite-directed metabolism of erythrocyte lipids and/or trafficking of lipids between the parasite and erythrocyte membranes." />

      <html_content value="[Neuropsychiatric symptoms in preventive antimalarial treatment with mefloquine: apropos of 2 cases]. Two observations of severe neuropsychiatric reactions occurring during chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine are reported. The first case regards a 43 years old woman who developed a severe depression with visual and auditive hallucinations and a paranoid delusion. She was treated by clomipramine and risperidone. The second case concerns a 55 years old man who developed an acute psychosis with confusion. He was treated with halopridol during a short time. He presented twice an acute psychosis during a chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine. Several cases of neuropsychiatric side effects with mefloquine chemoprophylaxis or treatment have been described. Authors estimate that one of 250 therapeutic users has severe neuropsychiatric reactions, compared with one of 10,000 to 15,000 in the prophylaxis users. Disorders could last from 15 minutes to several weeks. Women and patients with personal or familial antecedents of psychiatric disorders are more frequently concerned. Alcohol and the association with other antimalarial drugs (like quinine) are two other risk factors. Therefore, some advices may be suggested regarding the use of mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis and treatment." />
