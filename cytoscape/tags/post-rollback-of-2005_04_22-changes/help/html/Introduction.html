<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
Cytoscape is an open-source
community software project for integrating biomolecular interaction
networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular
states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to
any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is
most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of
protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are
increasingly available for humans and model organisms. A software
&#8220;Core&#8221; provides basic functionality to layout and query the
network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles,
phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to
databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a
straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of
additional computational analyses and features. <b><br>
<br>
The central
organizing metaphor of Cytoscape is a network graph, with genes,
proteins, and molecules represented as nodes and interactions
represented as links, i.e. edges, between nodes.</b>
