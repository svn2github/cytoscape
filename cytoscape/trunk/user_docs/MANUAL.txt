INTRODUCTION #########################################################
######################################################################

Cytoscape is a bioinformatics software platform for visualizing
molecular interaction networks and integrating these interactions with
other large data sets such as gene expression profiles.  It provides a
general framework for integrating information/measurements of network
connectivity with information/measurements of cellular state.  The
Cytoscape project is a large-scale collaborative effort between labs
at the MIT/Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, MA (Dr. Trey Ideker) and
the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, WA (Dr. Benno
Schwikowski).  The core software is implemented in Java, with several
time-critical algorithms coded in C++ and linked through a JNI bridge.
  
Cytoscape provides the following key features:

1) DATA INTEGRATION AND MANAGEMENT

   Import molecular interactions from flat files listing 
   protein-protein, protein-DNA, or other interaction type

   Load and save interaction networks and network layouts in GML
   format (Graph Markup Language) 

   Import of mRNA / protein expression profiles from space- or 
   tab-delimited text files

   Access to gene functional annotations from the Gene Ontology (GO)
   database

   Manual editing of the network, allowing for node and edge creation,
   deletion, positioning, and user-configured labels, colors, sizes,
   etc.

2) VISUALIZATION

   Graphical superposition of gene expression ratios and p-values on
   the network.  Expression data are mapped to node color, border 
   color, or label according to user-configurable visualization 
   schemes.  Expression sets are selected from a pulldown menu.

   Network layout in two dimensions.  A variety of algorithms are
   available, including Cyclic layout, Spring-Embedded layout, and 
   layout based on Network Cluster Identification

   Miscellaneous: zoom in/out, pan, print, spawn new viewer on selected 
   subgraph

3) NETWORK FILTERING: A system of nested filters is provided (based on 
   a general and extensible filtering API) to select subsets of nodes
   and/or interactions based on current data.  For instance, users may
   select nodes involved in a threshold number of interactions, nodes
   that share a particular GO annotation, nodes whose gene expression
   levels change significantly in specified conditions, or a
   combination of these criteria.

4) ACTIVE PATHWAYS AND SUBSYSTEMS: Active subsystems are connected 
   regions of the network that show significant changes in gene or 
   protein expression over particular experimental conditions.  By 
   screening the network to show active subsystems only, it is 
   possible to reduce the immense complexity of an entire interaction 
   network or database by pinpointing just those network regions that 
   are relevant to the conditions of interest.  Conversely, false 
   positive interactions and interactions not involved in the 
   expression response are removed from further analysis.  The 
   remaining active subsystems contain interactions that are concrete 
   hypotheses as to the underlying signaling and regulatory 
   mechanisms in the cell. This approach is described in:

   Ideker, Ozier, Schwikowski, and Siegel, Discovering Regulatory and 
   Signaling Circuits in Molecular Interaction Networks, to appear at 
   ISMB2002 and in Bioinformatics journal.

######################################################################
LAUNCHING CYTOSCAPE ##################################################
######################################################################

Basic instructions for installing and launching Cytoscape are provided
in the separate file "INSTALL.txt".  Cytoscape also recognizes a
number of optional command line arguments, including run-time
specification of network files and expression data:

 -g  <GML network filename>        (xxx.gml)
 -b  <bioData directory>           (e.g. GO/) 
 -i  <SIF interactions filename>   (yyy.sif)
 -e  <expression filename>         (zzz.pvals)
 -h  help: display these command line arguments
 -v  display version

Most data sets may also be loaded after Cytoscape is running.  See
section on LOADING DATA below.

Additional command line arguments that are not recognized by the
Cytoscape core are passed to the plug-in modules (e.g. the activePaths
plug-in included in this distribution). Please refer to the
documentation for each specific plug-in for more details.

######################################################################
BUILDING AND STORING INTERACTION NETWORKS ############################
######################################################################

Cytoscape reads an interaction network in two ways: from a simple
interaction file (SIF or .sif format) or from a universal format known
as Graph Markup Language (GML or .gml format).  SIF specifies
components and interactions only, while GML stores additional
information about network layout and allows network data exchange with
a variety of other network display programs.  Typically, SIF is used
to import interactions when building a network for the first time.
Once the interactions have been loaded and layout has been performed,
the network may be saved to and subsequently reloaded from GML format
in future Cytoscape sessions.  Both SIF and GML are implemented as
ASCII text files.

SIF FORMAT: 
Lines in the SIF file specify a source node, an interaction type, and
one or more target nodes:

geneA <interaction type> geneB
geneC <interaction type> geneA
geneD <interaction type> geneE geneF geneB
geneG
...
geneY <interaction type> geneZ

In the network specified by this file, genes are represented by nodes,
and interactions are represented by edges between nodes.  For
compactness, a gene also represents its corresponding protein.  Nodes
may also be used to represent compounds and reactions instead of
genes, but this is experimental.  Note that it is possible to specify
an isolated node with no interactions, as in the line "geneG" above.

Gene names must be unique.  If the network is to be integrated with
Gene Ontology (GO) or gene expression data, the gene names must
exactly match the systematic ORF names specified in the other data
files.  We strongly encourage naming genes and proteins by their
systematic ORF name; common names may be displayed on the screen for
ease of interpretation, so long as these are available to the program
in the bioData directory (Cytoscape ships with all yeast ORF-to-common
name mappings in a synonym table within the GO/ directory).

The tag <interaction type> must be one of:
   pp .................. protein -- protein
   pd .................. protein -> DNA

Additional interaction types are also available but experimental:
   pr .................. protein -> reaction
   rc .................. reaction -> compound      
   cr .................. compound -> reaction
   gl .................. genetic lethal relationship

GML FORMAT: In contrast to SIF, GML is a rich graph format language
supported by many other graph visualization packages.  Its file format
specification is available at:
http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/.  It is generally
not necessary to modify the content of a GML file directly.  Once a
network is built in SIF format and then laid out, the layout is
perserved by saving to and loading from GML.

COMMANDS:
Load and save network files using the File menu of Cytoscape. Network
files may also be loaded directly from the command line using the -i 
(SIF format) or -g (GML format) options.  

FOR EXAMPLE:
To load a sample molecular interaction network in SIF format, use the
menu File -> Load -> Interactions.  In the resulting file dialog box,
select the file "sampleData/galFiltered.sif". After a few seconds, a
small network of 329 nodes should appear in the main window. To load
the same interaction network as a GML, use the menu: File -> Load ->
GML. In the resulting file dialog box, select the file
"sampleData/galFiltered.gml".

EDITING THE NETWORK AFTER LOADING:
It is possible to add and delete nodes and edges from within the
visual interface.  Use the Edit menu to toggle between Read-only mode
(the default) and Edit mode.  In Edit mode, nodes are created by
left-clicking on the workspace.  Edges (i.e. representing molecular
interactions) are created by left-dragging from one node to another.
These editing features are still under development. Selected nodes
and edges are deleted from the Edit menu.

######################################################################
LOADING GENE EXPRESSION DATA #########################################
######################################################################

Interaction networks are certainly useful as stand-alone models.
However, they are most powerful when integrated with information about
the biological states that are induced by the network, such as gene or
protein expression levels.  Once loaded, expression ratios/levels may
be visually superimposed on the network, used in a filter to select a
subset of nodes, or used to identify active paths and subsystems (see
sections below).  Expression data are only relevant once a network has
been loaded.

FORMAT: 
Gene expression ratios are specified over one or more experiments
using an ASCII text file.  The file consists of a number of space- or
tab-delimited fields, one line per gene, with the following format:

GeneName [CommonName] ratio1 ratio2 ... ratioN [pval1 pval2 ... pvalN]

Brackets [] indicate fields that are optional.  The first two fields
are the systematic gene name followed by an optional common name.
Expression ratios are provided for each experiment, optionally
followed by a p-value per experiment or other measure of the
significance of each ratio, i.e. whether the ratio represents a true
change in expression.  Significance values are generated by a variety
of software packages for analyzing expression data generated by DNA
microarrays, for instance our program VERA
(http://www.systemsbiology.org/VERAandSAM).  A list of other
microarray analysis packages is available from:
http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/wli/microarray/soft.html

COMMANDS:
Load an expression data file using the File menu of Cytoscape or by
specifying the filename using the -e option at the command line.

FOR EXAMPLE:
Load a sample gene expression data set using the menu: File -> Load ->
Expression Matrix File. In the resulting file dialog box, select the
file "sampleData/gal1-20.pvals".  As described in the following
sections, Cytoscape is now ready to integrate these data with the
underlying molecular interaction network.

######################################################################
VISUALIZATION ########################################################
######################################################################

BASIC FEATURES:
Use the zooming buttons located on the toolbar to zoom in / out of
the interaction network shown in the current network display.

Navigate around the network by using the window sliders or by clicking
with the right mouse button (with no nodes or edges selected) and
dragging in the desired direction.

Use the left mouse button to select one or more nodes (genes).  A
right click then launches a node attributes panel providing detailed
information about the selected nodes, including its corresponding
annotation in the Gene Ontology (GO) database (if available and
specified with the -b command line option).  If a gene expression
experiment has been selected (see below), the relevant expression data
are also shown in the node attributes panel.

NETWORK LAYOUT:
Explore a variety of schemes for layout of the network in two
dimensions using the "Layout" menu.  First select the type of layout
desired (Circular, Hierarchical, ...)  and then choose "Whole graph"
or "Current Selection" to perform the layout on either all nodes or
only those that are currently selected.  It is also possible to align
selected nodes vertically or horizontally.  Saving a network in GML
format (see section above) records the network topology (nodes and
links) and its current layout.

CONFIGURING AND MAPPING VISUAL PROPERTIES:
Bring up the Visual Properties dialog by choosing Visualization -> Set
Visual Properties.  Default node and edge visual properties such as
color, size, and style are specified in the upper portion of the
dialog.  Defaults may also be configured at run-time by editing the
cytoscape.props file.  Please follow the models provided in the props
file that is included with this distribution.

A powerful feature of Cytoscape is that (in addition to the defaults)
it can also map visual properties to node- or edge-specific biological
information.  Several of these mappings are specified in the lower
portion of the visual properties dialog.  For instance, node label may
be mapped to display its gene name (canonical or common) or current
gene expression values if an experiment has been selected (see below).
Edge color may be used to reflect the type of interaction each edge
represents, e.g. protein-protein ('pp' tag) or protein->DNA ('pd'
tag).  As described next, one of the most important mappings is from
node color to gene expression values.

SUPERPOSITION OF EXPRESSION DATA ON THE NETWORK: 
To visually map and superimpose expression data on the network, choose
Visualization -> Overlay Expression Data. This function requires that
expression data are loaded in memory. The resulting dialog allows data
from any one of the currently loaded expression experiments to appear
as a color mapped to the node fill color or node border color.  Select
the particular experiment to display from the menu at left, and
specify the color mapping at right.  Either expression values
(i.e. ratios or levels) or significances (i.e.  p-values) may be
mapped.  After pressing "Apply", the color of each gene (network node)
will reflect its expression value in the selected experiment.

The initial expression color mapping which Cytoscape loads at run-time
is specified in the cytoscape.props file as a list of fields and their
comma-separated RGB values.  Follow the model provided in the props
file included with this distribution.

######################################################################
SELECTION AND FILTERING ##############################################
######################################################################

It is often useful to view and operate on a selected subset of nodes
and/or edges.  Individual nodes and edges are selected in the
Cytoscape window by a left mouse click or using the left mouse button
to drag a selection box around a group of nodes.  Holding down SHIFT
while selecting preserves any currently selected components.  Using
the variety of commands available in the Edit, View or Layout menus,
selected nodes and edges may be hidden from view, permanently deleted,
laid out separately, or displayed in a new Cytoscape window.

The Filters dialog allows the user to select groups of nodes based on
more complex queries.  Launch this dialog either from the menu bar or
by choosing View -> Select -> Using filters.  Six classes of
filters are currently available:

   Topology ............ Select nodes with more than a specified
                         number of edges
   Nodes Center ........ Select nodes within a specified distance from
                         one or more currently selected nodes
   Interaction ......... Select nodes involved in interactions of a
                         specified type (pp, pd, etc.) 
   Expression .......... Select nodes whose expression levels are
                         affected in one or more experiments, as well
                         as neighbors of these nodes
   Node Type ........... (Experimental) Select only those nodes that
                         are of the specified molecular type
   Combination ......... Combine several filters together using AND
                         or OR logic.

Through the use of the Combination filter, it is therefore possible to
construct arbitrarily complex selection queries.

FOR EXAMPLE:
Load the sample network (sampleData/gal1-20.pval) and expression data
set (sampleData/galFiltered.gml) as described in the preceding
sections.  Launch the Filters dialog from the menu bar and choose the
Topology1 tab.  Specify "3" as the minimum number of neighbors, "1" as
the depth, and choose "No" for the option "Apply Filter Until Stable
Point".  Pressing "Select" highlights the 64 nodes in the network with
more than 3 immediate neighbors.  Increase the depth to "2" and press
"Select" again.  This will select 117 additional nodes that lack 3
immediate neighbors but that have 3 neighbors within a distance of 2
edges away.  Next, hide all of the nonselected nodes using the menu
command View -> Node Selection -> Invert followed by View -> Node
Selection -> Hide.  As indicated in the message panel on the bottom
right of the main Cytoscape window, this operation takes the network
from 329 nodes / 357 edges to 256 nodes / 299 edges.

######################################################################
FINDING ACTIVE SUBSYSTEMS ############################################
######################################################################

In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein
and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important
resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene
regulatory dynamics. By integrating these interactions with
widely-available gene expression data, it is possible to generate
concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the
observed changes in gene expression.  The ActivePaths plugin is
designed to perform this integration systematically and at large
scale.  

The plugin works by filtering the molecular interaction network to
reveal active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that
show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of
conditions. It includes a rigorous statistical measure for scoring
subnetworks against expression data, along with a search algorithm for
identifying subnetworks with high score.  In this way, the activePaths
plugin is one example of how large-scale genomic approaches may be
used to uncover signaling and regulatory pathways in a systematic,
integrative fashion.

This plug-in implements methods described in the publication:
Trey Ideker, Owen Ozier, Benno Schwikowski, and Andrew F. Siegel,
Discovering regulatory and signaling circuits in molecular interaction
networks, ISMB2002 and Bioinformatics (in press).

NOTE:
To load the activePaths plugin, specify a network file (-i or -g
option) AND an expression file (-e option) on the command line. 
The plugin will NOT appear if these files are loaded from the
File menu after the application starts.

OPERATION:
Choosing "PlugIns -> Find Active Paths" launches the Active Paths
dialog.  Starting from a specified number of initial path "seeds", the
algorithm searches for paths with maximal score.  In this context, any
connected subnetwork of nodes and edges is allowed as a "path".  The
path score is obtained by combining the significance of expression
(p-values) over all nodes in the path such that paths containing many
genes with significant p-values are assigned a high score (see the
publication for more details).  When expression data are provided over
multiple experiments, a particular subset of experiments is chosen
that results in the highest score overall.

The Active Paths dialog contains several options that control how
high-scoring paths are found via a simulated annealing algorithm.
Starting from the specified "Number of Paths" (randomly seeded), the
algorithm anneals over the specified "Number of Iterations".  The top
scoring paths are displayed in the Cytoscape window at regular
intervals of iterations, controlled by the "Display Interval".
Specific options are discussed in more detail in the publication.  

Once options are set, press "Apply" to begin active path finding.
Another dialog appears requesting whether MonteCarlo statistics should
be generated on the fly or loaded from a file.  This is an advanced
option and users should generally choose to "generate" the values on
the fly. The generated montecarlo values are saved to the local
directory in the file "current.mc".  

Each time the Cytoscape window is updated during the annealing run,
a brief line of text is sent to standard output reporting the 
run status.  An example of this line is:

[ 0.0142 : 9241 : 0.01 ] scores: 7.45 19.4

The three numbers in brackets are the current temperature (decreasing
from the initial to the final specified values), the iteraction
number, and the amount of CPU time in seconds utilized since the last
screen update.  The two scores reported are the score of the current
highest-scoring subnetwork and the sum of scores over all of the
paths being tracked.

At the termination of annealing, the resulting high-scoring paths are
displayed (other nodes are hidden) and a matrix appears tabulating
which experimental conditions (rows) activated each path (columns).
Clicking on a column of this matrix selects the corresponding pathway
in the main Cytoscape window.

The ActivePaths plug-in may also be controlled from the command line
by specifying the following options:

    --APt0 <double>         initial temperature
    --APtf <double>         final temperature
    --APni <integer>        number of iterations
    --APnp <integer>        number of paths
    --APdi <integer>        display interval
    --APhs <integer>        minimum hub size
    --APrs <integer>        random seed
    --APqu <true|false>     apply quenching
    --APmc <string>         monte-carlo file name
    --APexit                save and exit after run
    --APhelp                prints these options

These options are used to automatically start ActivePaths once
Cytoscape is running.  It requires that a network file and expression
data are also specified from the command line.  When --APexit is
specified, this instructs the program to additionally save the
high-scoring active pathways to the current directory as the file
"paths.gml" and exit Cytoscape. This option is useful for running
ActivePaths from other programs or shell scripts.  

FOR EXAMPLE: 
Load the sample network (sampleData/gal1-20.pval) and expression data
set (sampleData/galFiltered.gml) as described in the preceding
sections.  Choose PlugIns -> Find Active Paths and enter the following
values as options:

   Iterations ............... 10000
   Number of Paths .......... 5
   Start Temp ............... 1
   Final Temp ............... 0.01
   Display Interval ......... 10
   Quenching ................ (on)
   Hubfinding ............... (off)
   Seed Graph ............... Non-Random

Press "Apply" and then "Generate" in the next dialog.  Annealing will
begin after a few seconds.  Although the run is nondeterministic,
annealing will typically produce a high scoring subnetwork of 35 nodes
and score 7 that is active in 14 out of the 20 experimental conditions
(indicated by red blocks in the matrix).  After the run, perform
layout on the resulting subnetworks by issuing the menu command
"Layout -> Organic" followed by "Whole graph".
