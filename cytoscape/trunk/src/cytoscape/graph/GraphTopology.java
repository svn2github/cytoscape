/**
 * A bare-minimum definition of a graph.  A given edge in a graph can
 * be either <i>directed</i> or <i>undirected</i>.  Directedness of edges
 * is an important part of graph topology for calculations such as
 * finding a path <i>from</i> node A <i>to</i> node B.  A number of edges
 * between two nodes may exist; this number may have significance in some
 * applications, and so we don't want to represent an undirected edge
 * simply as two directed edges which are exact opposites of each other.<p>
 * Some extreme cases of graphs representable with this object are
 * graphs containing only nodes and no edges.  Another strange graph is one
 * with just one node and a million edges.  An erroneous graph is one
 * with one edge and no nodes, because the presence of one edge implies that
 * at least one node exists (an edge may in fact start and end at the same
 * node).<p>
 * Topologists claim that they can't tell a donut apart from a coffee cup.
 * In fact, a coffee cup with a handle can be &quot;smoothly morphed&quot;
 * into a donut shape.  In topology, distances do not matter but connectedness
 * does.  Therefore, a topological definition of a graph should not
 * contain any notion of a &quot;distance along edge&quot;.<p>
 * The methods on this interface do not expose any mutable behavior; this does
 * not mean, however, that instances of this interface are not mutable.  A
 * sub-interface extending <code>GraphTopology</code> could be defined which
 * exposes mutable functionality.
